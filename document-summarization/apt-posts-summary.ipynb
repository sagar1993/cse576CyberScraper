      "APT10 Background  APT10 (MenuPass Group) is a Chinese cyber espionage group that FireEye has tracked since 2009. We believe that the targeting of these industries has been in support of Chinese national security goals, including acquiring valuable military and intelligence information as well as the theft of confidential business data to support Chinese corporations. Further collaboration between FireEye as a Service (FaaS), Mandiant and FireEye iSIGHT intelligence uncovered additional victims worldwide, a new suite of tools and novel techniques. We believe these companies are a mix of final targets and organizations that could provide a foothold in a final target. APT10 unveiled new tools in its 2016/2017 activity. In addition to the continued use of SOGU, the current wave of intrusions has involved new tools we believe are unique to APT10. It also conducts basic victim profiling activity, collecting the computer name, running process IDs, %TEMP% directory path and version of Internet Explorer. (For more information on infection via service providers see M-Trends 2016 ). Service providers have significant access to customer networks, enabling an attacker who had compromised a service provider to move laterally into the network of the service provider’s customer. In addition, web traffic between a service provider’s customer and a service provider is likely to be viewed as benign by network defenders at the customer, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate data stealthily. We believe the pace of APT10 operations may slow following the public disclosure by the PwC/BAE blog ; however, we believe they will return to their large-scale operations, potentially employing new tactics, techniques and procedures.\n",

      "The security industry, as well as IT administrators across the globe, has been busy recently dealing with multiple zero-day vulnerabilities emerging in quick succession. Well, for people in Japan at least, since the vulnerability is in the Japanese word-processing software Ichitaro. Ichitaro developer JustSystems recently announced that the Multiple Ichitaro Products Unspecified Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2013-5990), allowing the execution of arbitrary code, exists in Ichitaro products. As always, we exercised the responsible vulnerability disclosure process following this discovery. If the exploit is successful, in theory the shell code would be executed to drop and launch the simplified Chinese version of notepad.exe while compromising the system, with the back door connecting to a remote site. The files cannot be opened using Microsoft Word as they are designed to work only with Ichitaro. One of the emails used in this targeted attack campaign can be seen in the following figure.

      "The error enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted EPS image file. Over the following months, there was significant growth in the number of threat actors using the vulnerability as a primary tool for initial penetration, with both the attack groups and their targets located in South-East and Central Asia and the Far East. In this research paper, we discuss examples of attacks using the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability undertaken by some of these groups. Its attacks can be traced as far back as 2009. The group is notable for exploiting 0-day vulnerabilities and carrying out a small number of highly focused targeted attacks – mostly against government agencies in Malaysia, Indonesia, China and India. In order to infect victims, the attacker sent an email with an attached DOCX file exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office using an embedded EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) object. The document is written in good Japanese, as shown below. This attack was also described in the FireEye report , mentioned above.

      "CANCUN - KASPERSKY SECURITY ANALYST SUMMIT - The investigation into the September 2017 CCleaner incident has revealed what appears to be a stage three payload that attackers supposedly intended to deliver to infected users. Hackers had added a backdoor to the 32-bit CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 releases, Avast revealed. What led to this was the compromise of the distribution servers of Piriform, the company developing CCleaner, in the months before Avast purchased the software firm. In an August 2017 report, Kaspersky revealed that the ShadowPad backdoor was found in NetSarang’s products, which are used by hundreds of companies in the financial, software, media, energy, electronics, insurance, industrial, construction, manufacturing, retail, telecoms, pharmaceutical, and transportation sectors. “The tool was installed on the four Piriform computers on April 12th, 2017, while the preliminary version of the second stage had been installed on the computers March 12th, 2017,” Avast says.

      "Cyber Espionage Targets Interests in South China Sea\n",
      "A cyber espionage campaign has been discovered apparently targeting participants in the recent Permanent Court of Arbitration case brought by the Philippines against China over Chinese claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea. China itself did not accept the validity of the case, did not attend the arbitration, and has since rejected the ruling. It named it NanHaiShu, and has today published an analysis  of the methodology and malware involved. NanHaiShu (南海鼠) translates to \"South China Sea Rat\" in English. These include the Philippines Court of Justice, the organizers of last November's APEC Summit held in the Philippines (during which it was expected that the South China Sea dispute would be discussed), and a major international law firm that represents one of the parties in the dispute. The timeline of infections, targets and notable events around the arbitration does, however, provide compelling circumstantial evidence. The malware shows strong indications of Chinese origins, with code reused from Chinese forums. But F-Secure does not attribute the attacks to the Chinese government, nor even to a specific Chinese malware group. Since China was not present at an international arbitration case involving their own territorial claims means they would not have direct access to some of the information presented or discussed. Soon after after the ruling it commenced a major wargames exercise with, according to ZeroHedge, \"some 300 ships, dozens of fighter planes, and involved troops that are responsible for coastal defense radars, communications, and electronic warfare defense.\" He has been writing about high tech issues since before the birth of Microsoft.

      "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:\n",
      "On Tuesday September 17, 2013, Symantec’s Security Response organization published a whitepaper report on Hidden Lynx, a Chinese APT group of professional hackers with advanced capabilities. The distribution of Moudoor requires a sizeable number of people to both breach targets and retrieve the information from the compromised networks. The group makes use of regular zero-day exploits. Attacks against government contractors and, more specifically, the defense industry indicate that the group is in pursuit of confidential information and suggests that the group had been working for nation states. For customers with monitor-only IDS/IPS devices, Symantec MSS stands ready to provide security monitoring for these vulnerabilities once your IDS/IPS vendor releases signatures and those signatures are enabled on your monitored devices.\n",

      "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:\n",
      "On Tuesday September 17, 2013, Symantec’s Security Response organization published a whitepaper report on Hidden Lynx, a Chinese APT group of professional hackers with advanced capabilities. The distribution of Moudoor requires a sizeable number of people to both breach targets and retrieve the information from the compromised networks. This Trojan was leveraged for a special operation during the VOHO campaign and is probably used by a specific team of highly skilled attackers within the group. The group makes use of regular zero-day exploits. They are methodical in their approach and they display a skillset far in advance of some other attack groups also operating in that region, such as the Comment Crew (also known as APT1). TARGETS\n",
      "Since November 2011, hundreds of organizations worldwide have been targeted by the Hidden Lynx group. Attacks against government contractors and, more specifically, the defense industry indicate that the group is in pursuit of confidential information and suggests that the group had been working for nation states. For customers with monitor-only IDS/IPS devices, Symantec MSS stands ready to provide security monitoring for these vulnerabilities once your IDS/IPS vendor releases signatures and those signatures are enabled on your monitored devices.\n",

      "This group doesn’t just limit itself to a handful of targets; instead it targets hundreds of different organizations in many different regions, even concurrently. Given the breadth and number of targets and regions involved, we infer that this group is most likely a professional hacker-for-hire operation that are contracted by clients to provide information. What was particularly interesting about this attack was the use of the watering hole attack technique and the compromise of Bit9’s trusted file signing infrastructure. Once breached, the attackers quickly found their way into the file signing infrastructure that was the foundation of the Bit9 protection model, they then used this system to sign a number of malware files and then these files were used in turn to compromise the true intended targets.

      "For the past few years, reports have continued to emerge detailing the activities of actors behind various targeted attacks or Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). These supply chain attacks are carried out by infecting computers at a supplier of an intended target and then waiting for the infected computers to be installed and call home, clearly these are cool calculated actions rather than impulsive forays of amateurs. This group doesn’t just limit itself to a handful of targets; instead it targets hundreds of different organizations in many different regions, even concurrently. Given the breadth and number of targets and regions involved, we infer that this group is most likely a professional hacker-for-hire operation that are contracted by clients to provide information. The elite team uses a Trojan named Naid and are therefore referred to as Team Naid. What was particularly interesting about this attack was the use of the watering hole attack technique and the compromise of Bit9’s trusted file signing infrastructure.

The company was notified of the certificate abuse. The use of the publicly-available Earthworm tunneler is common to Chinese-speaking actors and one of the commands used by the attackers creates a tunnel to a previously known LuckyMouse server, which, paired with the choice of victims in this campaign, suggests that this actor is behind the attacks, Kaspersky says.

The group continues to use a non-executable infection vector and highly obfuscated scripts to evade detection. We also saw infections in China, India and Bangladesh. As a result, they are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks—intruders can intercept transmitted data by ‘persuading’ victims to install their certificate.

      "Our previous post on their 2017 activity stepped away from the previously covered headline buzz presenting their association with previously known political hacks and interest in Europe and the US, and examines their under-reported ongoing activity in middle east, central asia, and now a shift in targeting further east, including China, along with an overlap surprise. Because SPLM is their primary and selective second stage tool, SPLM deployment is of much interest. We observe the “retranslator” code, or ProcessRetranslator.dll, currently being delivered to systems without the presence of the previous, large, SPLM code and injection capabilities. Cryptography ranges from built-in windows api to custom RC4-based ciphers. Sofacy has been heavily interested in military and foreign affairs organizations here, resulting in multiple overlapped and competing targeting scenarios:   Mosquito Turla and Zebrocy clusters – Zebrocy clusters targeting diplomatic and commercial organizations within Europe and Asia that match Mosquito targeting profiling  SPLM overlap with traditional Turla – often Turla precedes SPLM deployments  SPLM overlap with Zebrocy – Zebrocy often precedes SPLM deployments  SPLM overlap with Danti   Currently, Sofacy targets large air-defense related commercial organizations in China with SPLM, and moves Zebrocy focus across Armenia, Turkey, Kazahkstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Mongolia, China, and Japan. And here, an interest in military technologies is certainly within Sofacy purview.

      "Who Hacked French President-elect Emmanuel Macron's Campaign? One phishing site, apparently created by APT28 on March 25, 2017 and clearly designed for the Macron campaign, 'onedrive-en-marche-dot-fr', was reported by Trend Micro in April. In a blog post on Tuesday, he demonstrated the ease with which anybody could edit metadata and pretend to be anyone. The Macron hack occurred far later in the election campaign than the DNC hack; the phishing emails appear to be far clumsier; and the email leak occurred too late to have any effect on the election outcome. The New York Times reported, \"'We created false accounts, with false content, as traps. We did this massively, to create the obligation for them to verify, to determine whether it was a real account,' Mr. Mahjoubi [the campaign's digital director] said. And if the intruder does manage to exfiltrate any data, it is false data. In other words, it can explain but does not prove why the leak occurred so late -- the attackers simply didn't know what to leak. But the timing of the document leaks was far too late to benefit Le Pen, and would more likely benefit Macron. \"If it's information warfare -- rather than cyber warfare,\" suggests F-Secure security advisor Sean Sullivan, \"then the point is not stealth. He has been writing about high tech issues since before the birth of Microsoft.

Once received, Responder masquerades as the sought-out resource and causes the victim computer to send the username and hashed password to the attacker-controlled machine. “Cyber espionage activity against the hospitality industry is typically focused on collecting information on or from hotel guests of interest rather than on the hotel industry itself, though actors may also collect information on the hotel as a means of facilitating operations,” FireEye said. “Business and government personnel who are traveling, especially in a foreign country, must often rely on less secure systems to conduct business than at their home office, or may be unfamiliar with the additional threats posed while abroad.”\n",

Microsoft pointed out that the Turla attacks were first spotted in March, and customers who had up-to-date systems had already been protected as CVE-2017-0001 was patched earlier that month.

      "The Russia-linked cyber espionage group Sofacy has been targeting foreign affairs agencies and ministries worldwide in a recently discovered campaign, Palo Alto Networks warns. The hacking group, also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Tsar Team, and Strontium, has been highly active recently, and new evidence shows activity directly targeting diplomats in North America and Europe, including those at a European embassy in Moscow. Both the loader and the SofacyCarberp variant used in the attack are similar to samples previously analyzed, yet they include several differences, such as a new hashing algorithm to resolve API functions and find browser processes for injection, and modified C&C communication mechanisms. The only difference between the two, besides random function name and random cell values, would be the path to the “.txt” and “.exe” files.

While authorities did not have concrete proof, they have pinned the malware attack that crippled the Bundestag parliamentary network in 2015 for days on the APT28, also known as \"Fancy Bear\" or \"Sofacy\". Amid the rising frequency of attacks, Germany's defence ministry in 2016 set up a cyber department to coordinate a response to online intrusions.

It is one of the two supposedly Russian threat groups believed to have breached the systems of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC). Shortly after news broke that Russian hackers had targeted DNC systems, researchers at SecureWorks reported that Pawn Storm had attempted to steal credentials associated with nearly 4,000 Gmail accounts between October 2015 and May 2016. In this campaign, attackers used a domain named “accoounts-google.com” to trick users into handing over their Google credentials.

Adobe noted in its advisory that it’s aware of limited, targeted attacks exploiting the flaw. Pawn Storm has used six zero-day vulnerabilities in the last year, Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro, told SecurityWeek on Tuesday. This includes Java, Windows, and Flash Player zero-days, including some of the exploits leaked as a result of the breach suffered earlier this year by the Italian spyware maker Hacking Team.

Many believe he will become the county’s next president after he was endorsed by several top politicians, including former opponents in the presidential race. Researchers have identified tens of military, government, defense, media, political, religious, educational and international organizations targeted by the group. The National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) also confirmed the attacks, but refused to comment on their origin, Reuters reported. The KAS phishing site, named kassap.de, was created in early April.

How we decide to treat these offensive cyber operations is one of the most pressing questions of our time, and those questions cannot be answered by governments alone. An effective security solution must do more than just verify a user name and password. It should also be able to ask for additional authentication steps like one-time passwords (OTP), adjust user permissions on the fly and ultimately block access according to the level of risk.

Targets and victims included ASEAN governmental agencies and government departments, investment enterprises, military, law enforcement and border control organizations, embassies, university faculties and others.

      "APT33 has shown particular interest in organizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities, as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production. We assess the targeting of multiple companies with aviation-related partnerships to Saudi Arabia indicates that APT33 may possibly be looking to gain insights on Saudi Arabia’s military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran’s domestic aviation capabilities or to support Iran’s military and strategic decision making vis a vis Saudi Arabia. Iran has expressed interest in growing their petrochemical industry and often posited this expansion in competition to Saudi petrochemical companies. Figure 1: Scope of APT33 Targeting  Spear Phishing  APT33 sent spear phishing emails to employees whose jobs related to the aviation industry. Figure 2: Excerpt of an APT33 malicious .hta file  We assess APT33 used a built-in phishing module within the publicly available ALFA TEaM Shell (aka ALFASHELL) to send hundreds of spear phishing emails to targeted individuals in 2016. As shown in Figure 3, the “fake mail” phishing module in the ALFA Shell contains default values, including the sender email address (solevisible@gmail[. Figure 3: ALFA TEaM Shell v2-Fake Mail (Default)  Figure 4 shows an example email containing the default values the shell. Figure 4: Example Email Generated by the ALFA Shell with Default Values  Domain Masquerading  APT33 registered multiple domains that masquerade as Saudi Arabian aviation companies and Western organizations that together have partnerships to provide training, maintenance and support for Saudi’s military and commercial fleet. Identified Persona Linked to Iranian Government  We identified APT33 malware tied to an Iranian persona who may have been employed by the Iranian government to conduct cyber threat activity against its adversaries. Kaspersky also noted the difference in resource language sections: SHAMOON embeds Arabic-Yemen language resources while DROPSHOT embeds Farsi (Persian) language resources. APT33’s focus on aviation may indicate the group’s desire to gain insight into regional military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran’s aviation capabilities or to support Iran’s military and strategic decision making. Their targeting of multiple holding companies and organizations in the energy sectors align with Iranian national priorities for growth, especially as it relates to increasing petrochemical production. ]com   TURNEDUP   www.securityupdated[. ]net   TURNEDUP   syn.broadcaster[.\n",

      "Industry professionals contacted by SecurityWeek all say that there is a strong possibility of attacks, but they mostly agree that Iran will likely not try to cause too much damage as that could lead to massive response from the United States and its allies. Iran is only likely to use significant destructive capabilities if the situation escalates or the US expands its role in supporting Saudi Arabia. Given Iran's growth over the last five years in the cyber domain, I would expect them to at least be initially successful against civilian targets in the US should they decide to go that route. From a technical perspective they have more than enough capability to carry out successful attacks, as we have seen in the Middle East and the United States. The thing that will reduce their operational capacity is if the US government takes a proactive and aggressive counter cyber posture and actively disrupts Iran's program before an attack is launched. The latest attacks represented the continued loss of intellectual property of our nation. Iran most certainly has the capability of launching significant attacks but I would view that probability to be low. Taking action, putting lives at risk could result in a kinetic response from the US and/or its allies as well as put into question Europe’s current support of the agreement. The U.S. needs cybersecurity leadership today more than ever if we are to stand a chance at defending the country from nation-state sponsored cyber attacks. For example, it’s well reported that groups such as the Shadow Brokers have released and brokered tools from the NSA. Ironically, today is the day that the EU NIS Directive becomes law in all 28 EU Member States.”\n",

The list of targets includes organizations in the chemicals, manufacturing, electronics, aerospace, healthcare, and automotive sectors. The deal fell through, which is when APT37 started hacking the Middle Eastern company, likely in an effort to collect information, FireEye said. “Though they have primarily tapped other tracked suspected North Korean teams to carry out the most aggressive actions, APT37 is an additional tool available to the regime, perhaps even desirable for its relative obscurity.\n",

In fact, actors operating from the same country have been often observed sharing malware code and infrastructure, which often makes attribution highly problematic. Thus there’s a workforce of hackers that focuses on cybercrime activities such as hacking into financial institutions (Unit 180) and another to gather intelligence from other nations and to try to disrupt rival states and military targets (Unit 121).

      "APT10 Background  APT10 (MenuPass Group) is a Chinese cyber espionage group that FireEye has tracked since 2009. We believe that the targeting of these industries has been in support of Chinese national security goals, including acquiring valuable military and intelligence information as well as the theft of confidential business data to support Chinese corporations. Further collaboration between FireEye as a Service (FaaS), Mandiant and FireEye iSIGHT intelligence uncovered additional victims worldwide, a new suite of tools and novel techniques. We believe these companies are a mix of final targets and organizations that could provide a foothold in a final target. APT10 unveiled new tools in its 2016/2017 activity. In addition to the continued use of SOGU, the current wave of intrusions has involved new tools we believe are unique to APT10. It also conducts basic victim profiling activity, collecting the computer name, running process IDs, %TEMP% directory path and version of Internet Explorer. (For more information on infection via service providers see M-Trends 2016 ). Service providers have significant access to customer networks, enabling an attacker who had compromised a service provider to move laterally into the network of the service provider’s customer. In addition, web traffic between a service provider’s customer and a service provider is likely to be viewed as benign by network defenders at the customer, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate data stealthily. We believe the pace of APT10 operations may slow following the public disclosure by the PwC/BAE blog ; however, we believe they will return to their large-scale operations, potentially employing new tactics, techniques and procedures.\n",

Evidence uncovered by investigators led them to believe that the attack was conducted by a China-linked cyber espionage group known as APT10, MenuPass and Stone Panda.

      "Fidelis Cybersecurity published a report detailing the campaign on Thursday, just hours before a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. The company noticed in late February that the website of the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) had been hacked and set up to serve malware in what is known as a watering hole attack, or a strategic web compromise. Evidence uncovered by investigators led them to believe that the attack was conducted by a China-linked cyber espionage group known as APT10, MenuPass and Stone Panda. According to researchers, the hackers set up certain web pages of the NFTC website to serve a reconnaissance framework known as Scanbox.

Well, for people in Japan at least, since the vulnerability is in the Japanese word-processing software Ichitaro.

      "The error enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted EPS image file. Over the following months, there was significant growth in the number of threat actors using the vulnerability as a primary tool for initial penetration, with both the attack groups and their targets located in South-East and Central Asia and the Far East. In this research paper, we discuss examples of attacks using the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability undertaken by some of these groups. Its attacks can be traced as far back as 2009. The group is notable for exploiting 0-day vulnerabilities and carrying out a small number of highly focused targeted attacks – mostly against government agencies in Malaysia, Indonesia, China and India. In order to infect victims, the attacker sent an email with an attached DOCX file exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office using an embedded EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) object. The document is written in good Japanese, as shown below. This attack was also described in the FireEye report , mentioned above.

      "CANCUN - KASPERSKY SECURITY ANALYST SUMMIT - The investigation into the September 2017 CCleaner incident has revealed what appears to be a stage three payload that attackers supposedly intended to deliver to infected users. Hackers had added a backdoor to the 32-bit CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 releases, Avast revealed. What led to this was the compromise of the distribution servers of Piriform, the company developing CCleaner, in the months before Avast purchased the software firm. In an August 2017 report, Kaspersky revealed that the ShadowPad backdoor was found in NetSarang’s products, which are used by hundreds of companies in the financial, software, media, energy, electronics, insurance, industrial, construction, manufacturing, retail, telecoms, pharmaceutical, and transportation sectors. “The tool was installed on the four Piriform computers on April 12th, 2017, while the preliminary version of the second stage had been installed on the computers March 12th, 2017,” Avast says.

      "A cyber espionage campaign has been discovered apparently targeting participants in the recent Permanent Court of Arbitration case brought by the Philippines against China over Chinese claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea. China itself did not accept the validity of the case, did not attend the arbitration, and has since rejected the ruling. It named it NanHaiShu, and has today published an analysis  of the methodology and malware involved. NanHaiShu (南海鼠) translates to \"South China Sea Rat\" in English. These include the Philippines Court of Justice, the organizers of last November's APEC Summit held in the Philippines (during which it was expected that the South China Sea dispute would be discussed), and a major international law firm that represents one of the parties in the dispute. The timeline of infections, targets and notable events around the arbitration does, however, provide compelling circumstantial evidence. The malware shows strong indications of Chinese origins, with code reused from Chinese forums. But F-Secure does not attribute the attacks to the Chinese government, nor even to a specific Chinese malware group. Since China was not present at an international arbitration case involving their own territorial claims means they would not have direct access to some of the information presented or discussed.

It spread via unofficial Chinese app stores with popular, cracked games. To do so, the Trojans stealthily download and install apps on the victim’s mobile device, and then give that app the highest possible rating in the app store.

      "On Tuesday September 17, 2013, Symantec’s Security Response organization published a whitepaper report on Hidden Lynx, a Chinese APT group of professional hackers with advanced capabilities. The distribution of Moudoor requires a sizeable number of people to both breach targets and retrieve the information from the compromised networks. This Trojan was leveraged for a special operation during the VOHO campaign and is probably used by a specific team of highly skilled attackers within the group. The group makes use of regular zero-day exploits. They are methodical in their approach and they display a skillset far in advance of some other attack groups also operating in that region, such as the Comment Crew (also known as APT1). TARGETS\n",
      "Since November 2011, hundreds of organizations worldwide have been targeted by the Hidden Lynx group.

      "For the past few years, reports have continued to emerge detailing the activities of actors behind various targeted attacks or Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). These supply chain attacks are carried out by infecting computers at a supplier of an intended target and then waiting for the infected computers to be installed and call home, clearly these are cool calculated actions rather than impulsive forays of amateurs. This group doesn’t just limit itself to a handful of targets; instead it targets hundreds of different organizations in many different regions, even concurrently. Given the breadth and number of targets and regions involved, we infer that this group is most likely a professional hacker-for-hire operation that are contracted by clients to provide information. The elite team uses a Trojan named Naid and are therefore referred to as Team Naid. What was particularly interesting about this attack was the use of the watering hole attack technique and the compromise of Bit9’s trusted file signing infrastructure.

      "The domain used by the malware for command and control (C&C) communications is adobesys[dot]com. In September 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, agreed not to conduct cyber espionage for economic gain. FireEye reported in June that Chinese spying had dropped in volume and became more focused. Researchers pointed out that China’s DaJiang Innovation Technology (DJI) is one of the world’s largest drone makers and currently holds roughly 70 percent of the market share. Targeting a European competitor can help the company maintain its position as a leader in this sector. “While Chinese cyber-enabled economic espionage may be less pronounced, it almost certainly hasn’t ended and likely has evolved to help solidify leading market shares. Furthermore, China may also be attempting to be more efficient as it focuses collection on organizations that meet multiple intelligence requirements.

The group continues to use a non-executable infection vector and highly obfuscated scripts to evade detection. We also saw infections in China, India and Bangladesh. As a result, they are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks—intruders can intercept transmitted data by ‘persuading’ victims to install their certificate.

Cryptography ranges from built-in windows api to custom RC4-based ciphers. Sofacy has been heavily interested in military and foreign affairs organizations here, resulting in multiple overlapped and competing targeting scenarios:   Mosquito Turla and Zebrocy clusters – Zebrocy clusters targeting diplomatic and commercial organizations within Europe and Asia that match Mosquito targeting profiling  SPLM overlap with traditional Turla – often Turla precedes SPLM deployments  SPLM overlap with Zebrocy – Zebrocy often precedes SPLM deployments  SPLM overlap with Danti   Currently, Sofacy targets large air-defense related commercial organizations in China with SPLM, and moves Zebrocy focus across Armenia, Turkey, Kazahkstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Mongolia, China, and Japan.

      "Who Hacked French President-elect Emmanuel Macron's Campaign? One phishing site, apparently created by APT28 on March 25, 2017 and clearly designed for the Macron campaign, 'onedrive-en-marche-dot-fr', was reported by Trend Micro in April. In a blog post on Tuesday, he demonstrated the ease with which anybody could edit metadata and pretend to be anyone. The Macron hack occurred far later in the election campaign than the DNC hack; the phishing emails appear to be far clumsier; and the email leak occurred too late to have any effect on the election outcome. The New York Times reported, \"'We created false accounts, with false content, as traps. We did this massively, to create the obligation for them to verify, to determine whether it was a real account,' Mr. Mahjoubi [the campaign's digital director] said. And if the intruder does manage to exfiltrate any data, it is false data. In other words, it can explain but does not prove why the leak occurred so late -- the attackers simply didn't know what to leak. But the timing of the document leaks was far too late to benefit Le Pen, and would more likely benefit Macron. \"If it's information warfare -- rather than cyber warfare,\" suggests F-Secure security advisor Sean Sullivan, \"then the point is not stealth.

Attacks involving SPLM and a tool tracked as Zebrocy were increasingly spotted between the second and fourth quarters of 2017 further east. As for the infrastructure used in these attacks, researchers pointed out that Sofacy has been fairly consistent throughout the years and many of its techniques and patterns have been publicly disclosed. Mass campaigns appear to have given way to subsets of activity and malware involving such tools as Zebrocy and SPLM.”\n",

Maassen describes the method and motivation behind the APT28 campaign. \"Propaganda, disinformation, cyber-attacks, cyber espionage and cyber sabotage are part of hybrid threats against western democracies.\" By playing to European concerns over uncontrolled immigration and refugee support, and by fostering nationalism within individual member states -- in this instance Germany -- Russia will be able to weaken the existing European sanctions.

      "The United States on Thursday announced sanctions against Russian spy agencies and more than a dozen individuals for trying to influence the 2016 presidential election and launching cyberattacks, including the destructive NotPetya campaign and operations targeting energy firms. On March 12 and March 14, security firm Palo Alto Networks spotted attacks launched by Sofacy against an unnamed European government agency using an updated variant of a known tool. Sofacy has been using a Flash Player exploit platform dubbed DealersChoice since at least 2016 and it has continued improving it.

WikiLeaks later published a large number of emails obtained by hackers from the systems of the DNC.

Experts from Fidelis Cybersecurity and ThreatConnect analyzed secure.actblues[. ]com, a domain designed to spoof secure.actblue[. The timing of the fake ActBlue domain’s registration also indicates a link to the DNC hack. “This suggests that, after being outed, FANCY BEAR actors shifted their operation immediately to another target that might allow them to continue collection against Democratic figures involved in the U.S. election,” researchers said.

These persistent and methodical attackers have successfully targeted organizations across these regions for a decade, and have largely evaded detection until recently. Asia’s businesses and governments are heavily targeted, but without the ability to detect these attacks they are largely unprotected from their impacts. This group has been able to operate successfully and remain undetected for many years and has not even had to change their attack infrastructure – a clear sign that their victims don’t realize this is happening. The economic and diplomatic impacts of such espionage are very serious; since most governments and businesses in the region don't have the ability to detect, prevent, analyze and respond to these attacks, we may never know the full impact of APT30.\n",

Targets and victims included ASEAN governmental agencies and government departments, investment enterprises, military, law enforcement and border control organizations, embassies, university faculties and others. The Naikon attackers attempted to exfiltrate sensitive geo-political, military, and economic data; to intercept communications and to maintain surveillance on their victims throughout the MsnMM campaigns. Their toolset and techniques changed over time in many minor ways, and appear to be run by Chinese-speaking individuals.

      "APT33 has shown particular interest in organizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities, as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production. We assess the targeting of multiple companies with aviation-related partnerships to Saudi Arabia indicates that APT33 may possibly be looking to gain insights on Saudi Arabia’s military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran’s domestic aviation capabilities or to support Iran’s military and strategic decision making vis a vis Saudi Arabia. Iran has expressed interest in growing their petrochemical industry and often posited this expansion in competition to Saudi petrochemical companies. Figure 1: Scope of APT33 Targeting  Spear Phishing  APT33 sent spear phishing emails to employees whose jobs related to the aviation industry. Figure 2: Excerpt of an APT33 malicious .hta file  We assess APT33 used a built-in phishing module within the publicly available ALFA TEaM Shell (aka ALFASHELL) to send hundreds of spear phishing emails to targeted individuals in 2016. As shown in Figure 3, the “fake mail” phishing module in the ALFA Shell contains default values, including the sender email address (solevisible@gmail[. Figure 3: ALFA TEaM Shell v2-Fake Mail (Default)  Figure 4 shows an example email containing the default values the shell. Figure 4: Example Email Generated by the ALFA Shell with Default Values  Domain Masquerading  APT33 registered multiple domains that masquerade as Saudi Arabian aviation companies and Western organizations that together have partnerships to provide training, maintenance and support for Saudi’s military and commercial fleet. Identified Persona Linked to Iranian Government  We identified APT33 malware tied to an Iranian persona who may have been employed by the Iranian government to conduct cyber threat activity against its adversaries. Kaspersky also noted the difference in resource language sections: SHAMOON embeds Arabic-Yemen language resources while DROPSHOT embeds Farsi (Persian) language resources. APT33’s focus on aviation may indicate the group’s desire to gain insight into regional military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran’s aviation capabilities or to support Iran’s military and strategic decision making. Their targeting of multiple holding companies and organizations in the energy sectors align with Iranian national priorities for growth, especially as it relates to increasing petrochemical production. ]com   TURNEDUP   www.securityupdated[. ]net   TURNEDUP   syn.broadcaster[.\n",

      "Industry professionals contacted by SecurityWeek all say that there is a strong possibility of attacks, but they mostly agree that Iran will likely not try to cause too much damage as that could lead to massive response from the United States and its allies. Iran is only likely to use significant destructive capabilities if the situation escalates or the US expands its role in supporting Saudi Arabia. Given Iran's growth over the last five years in the cyber domain, I would expect them to at least be initially successful against civilian targets in the US should they decide to go that route. From a technical perspective they have more than enough capability to carry out successful attacks, as we have seen in the Middle East and the United States. The thing that will reduce their operational capacity is if the US government takes a proactive and aggressive counter cyber posture and actively disrupts Iran's program before an attack is launched. The latest attacks represented the continued loss of intellectual property of our nation. Iran most certainly has the capability of launching significant attacks but I would view that probability to be low. Taking action, putting lives at risk could result in a kinetic response from the US and/or its allies as well as put into question Europe’s current support of the agreement. The U.S. needs cybersecurity leadership today more than ever if we are to stand a chance at defending the country from nation-state sponsored cyber attacks. For example, it’s well reported that groups such as the Shadow Brokers have released and brokered tools from the NSA. Ironically, today is the day that the EU NIS Directive becomes law in all 28 EU Member States.”\n",

In fact, actors operating from the same country have been often observed sharing malware code and infrastructure, which often makes attribution highly problematic. Thus there’s a workforce of hackers that focuses on cybercrime activities such as hacking into financial institutions (Unit 180) and another to gather intelligence from other nations and to try to disrupt rival states and military targets (Unit 121).

      "The MsnMM Campaigns [pdf]  For over half a decade, the Naikon APT waged multiple attack campaigns on sensitive targets throughout South-eastern Asia and around the South China Sea. Targets and victims included ASEAN governmental agencies and government departments, investment enterprises, military, law enforcement and border control organizations, embassies, university faculties and others. The Naikon attackers attempted to exfiltrate sensitive geo-political, military, and economic data; to intercept communications and to maintain surveillance on their victims throughout the MsnMM campaigns. Their toolset and techniques changed over time in many minor ways, and appear to be run by Chinese-speaking individuals. The consistent list of military, economic, and political targets gave away the actor’s interests.\n",
