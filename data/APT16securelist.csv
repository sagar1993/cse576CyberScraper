Overview    By David Emm , Roman Unuchek on August 11, 2016. 10:57 am       Contents   Targeted attacks and malware campaigns Cha-ching! Skimming off the cream New attacks, old exploit New attack, new exploit XDedic: APT-as-a-Service Lurking around the Russian Internet Malware stories Cybercriminals get ready for Rio Ransomware: backup or pay up? Mobile malware Data breaches     Download the full report (PDF)  Targeted attacks and malware campaigns  Cha-ching! Skimming off the cream  Earlier in the year, as part of an incident response investigation, we uncovered a new version of the Skimer ATM malware new ATM infector Rather than the well-established method of fitting a fake card-reader to the ATM, the attackers take control over the whole ATM. They start by installing the Skimer malware on the ATM \xe2\x80\x93 either through physical access or by compromising the bank\xe2\x80\x99s internal network. The malware infects the ATM\xe2\x80\x99s core \xe2\x80\x93 the part of the device responsible for interaction with the wider bank infrastructure, card processing and dispensing of cash. In contrast to a traditional card skimmer, there are no physical signs that the ATM is infected, leaving the attackers free to capture data from cards used at the ATM (including a customer\xe2\x80\x99s bank account number and PIN) or steal cash directly. The cybercriminal \xe2\x80\x98wakes up\xe2\x80\x99 the infected ATM by inserting a card that contains specific records on the magnetic stripe. After reading the card, Skimer is able execute a hard-coded command, or receive commands through a special menu activated by the card. The Skimer user interface appears on the display only after the card is ejected and only if the cybercriminal enters the correct session key within 60 seconds. The menu offers 21 different options, including dispensing money, collecting details of cards that have been inserted in the ATM, self-deletion and performing updates. The cybercriminal can save card details on the chip of their card, or print the details it has collected. The attackers are careful to avoid attracting attention. Rather than take money directly from the ATM \xe2\x80\x93 which would be noticed immediately \xe2\x80\x93 they wait (sometimes for several months) before taking action. In most cases, they collect data from skimmed cards in order to create cloned cards later. They use the cloned cards in other, non-infected ATMs, casually withdrawing money from the accounts of the victims in a way that can\xe2\x80\x99t be linked back to the compromised ATM. Kaspersky Lab has several recommendations to help banks protect themselves. They should carry out regular anti-virus scans; employ whitelisting technologies; apply a good device management policy; make use of full disk encryption; password protect the BIOS of ATMs; enforce hard disk booting and isolate the ATM network from the rest of the bank infrastructure. The magnetic strip of the card used by the cybercriminals to activate the malware contains nine hard-coded numbers. Banks may be able to proactively look for these numbers within their processing systems: so we have shared this information, along with other Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) . In April, one of our experts provided an in-depth examination of ATM jackpotting and offered some insights into what should be done to secure these devices. New attacks, old exploit In recent months we have been tracking a wave of cyber-espionage attacks conducted by different APT groups across the Asia-Pacific and Far East regions. They all share one common feature: they exploit the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability. This flaw enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted EPS image file. It uses PostScript and can evade the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention Danti, first identified in February 2016 and still active, is highly focused on diplomatic bodies. The group predominantly targets Indian government organizations, but data from the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) indicates that it has also infected targets in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Nepal and the Philippines. The exploit is delivered using spear-phishing e-mails spoofed to look as though they have been sent by high-ranking Indian government officials. When the victim clicks on the attached DOCX file, the Danti backdoor is installed, allowing the attackers to capture sensitive data. The origin of the Danti group is unclear, but we suspect that it might be connected to the NetTraveler and DragonOK groups: it\xe2\x80\x99s thought that Chinese-speaking hackers are behind these attacks. Kaspersky Las has also seen another campaign that makes use of the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability: we\xe2\x80\x99ve called this SVCMONDR after the Trojan that is downloaded once the attackers get a foothold in the victim\xe2\x80\x99s computer. This Trojan is different to the one used by the Danti group, but it shares some common features with Danti and with APT16 \xe2\x80\x93 the latter is a cyber-espionage group believed to be of Chinese origin. One of the most striking aspects of these attacks is that they are successfully making use of a vulnerability that was patched by Microsoft in September 2015. In November, we predicted that APT campaigns would invest less effort in developing sophisticated tools and make greater use of off-the-shelf malware to achieve their goals . This is a case in point: using a known vulnerability, rather than developing a zero-day exploit. This underlines the need for companies to pay more attention to patch management to secure their IT infrastructure. New attack, new exploit Of course, there will always be APT groups that seek to take advantage of zero-day exploits. In June, we reported on a cyber-espionage campaign \xe2\x80\x93 code-named \xe2\x80\x98 Operation Daybreak \xe2\x80\x98 and launched by a group named ScarCruft \xe2\x80\x93 that uses a previously unknown Adobe Flash Player exploit (CVE-2016-1010). This group is relatively new and has so far managed to stay under the radar. We think the group might have previously deployed another zero-day exploit (CVE-2016-0147) that was patched in April. The group have targeted a range of organizations in Russia, Nepal, South Korea, China, India, Kuwait and Romania. These include an Asian law enforcement agency, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest trading companies, a mobile advertising and app monetization company in the United States, individuals linked to the International Association of Athletics Federations and a restaurant located in one of Dubai\xe2\x80\x99s top shopping centres. The attacks started in March 2016: since some of them are very recent, we believe that the group is still active. The exact method used to infect victims is unclear, but we think that the attackers use spear-phishing e-mails that point to a hacked website hosting the exploit. The site performs a couple of browser checks before redirecting victims to a server controlled by the hackers in Poland. The exploitation process consists of three Flash objects. The one that triggers the vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player is located in the second SWF file delivered to the victim. At the end of the exploitation chain, the server sends a legitimate PDF file, called \xe2\x80\x98china.pdf\xe2\x80\x99, to the victim: this seems to be written in Korean. In Q2 2016, @kaspersky #mobile security products detected 3.6M malicious installation packages #KLreport Tweet The attackers use a number of interesting methods to evade detection, including exploiting a bug in the Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) component in order to bypass security solutions \xe2\x80\x93 a method not seen before. This flaw has been reported to Microsoft. Flash Player exploits are becoming rare, because in most cases they need to be coupled with a sandbox bypass exploit \xe2\x80\x93 this makes them tricky to do. Moreover, although Adobe is planning to drop Flash support soon, it continues to implement new mitigations to make exploitation of Flash Player increasingly difficult. Nevertheless, resourceful groups such as ScarCruft will continue to try and find zero-day exploits to target high-profile victims. While there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as 100 per cent security, the key is to increase security defences to the point that it becomes so expensive for an attacker to breach them that they give up or choose an alternative target. The best defence against targeted attacks is a multi-layered approach that combines traditional anti-virus technologies with patch management, host-based intrusion prevention and a default-deny whitelisting strategy. According to a study by the Australian Signals Directorate, 85 per cent of targeted attacks analysed could have been stopped by employing four simple mitigation strategies : application whitelisting, updating applications, updating operating systems and restricting administrative privileges. Kaspersky Lab products detect the Flash exploit as \xe2\x80\x98HEUR:Exploit.SWF.Agent.gen\xe2\x80\x99. The attack is also blocked proactively by our Automatic Exploit Prevention (AEP) component. The payloads are detected as \xe2\x80\x98HEUR:Trojan.Win32.ScarCruft.gen\xe2\x80\x99. XDedic: APT-as-a-Service Kaspersky Lab recently investigated an active cybercriminal trading platform called xDedic , an online black market for hacked server credentials around the world \xe2\x80\x93 all available through the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). We initially thought that this market extended to 70,000 servers, but new data suggests that the XDedic market is much wider \xe2\x80\x93 including credentials for 176,000 servers. XDedic includes a search engine, enabling potential buyers to find almost anything \xe2\x80\x93 from government and corporate networks \xe2\x80\x93 for as little as $8 per server. This low price provides \xe2\x80\x98customers\xe2\x80\x99 with access to data on such servers and their use as a bridgehead for further targeted attacks. The owners of the \xe2\x80\x98xdedic[.]biz\xe2\x80\x99 domain claim that they have no relation to those selling access to hacked servers \xe2\x80\x93 they are simply selling a secure trading platform for others. The XDedic forum has a separate sub-domain, \xe2\x80\x98partner[.]xdedic[.]biz\xe2\x80\x99, for the site\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98partners\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 that is, those selling hacked servers. The Xdedic owners have developed a tool that automatically collects information about the system, including websites available, software installed and more. They also provide others tools to its partners, including a patch for RDP servers to support multiple logins for the same user and proxy installers. The existence of underground markets is not new. But we are seeing a greater level of specialisation. And while the model adopted by the XDedic owners isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that can be replicated easily, we think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that other specialized markets are likely to appear in the future. Data from KSN helped us identify several files that were downloaded from the XDedic partner portal: Kaspersky Lab products detect these files as malicious. We have also blacklisted the URLs of control servers used for gathering information about the infected systems. Our detailed report on XDedic contains more information on hosts and network-based IoCs . Lurking around the Russian Internet Sometimes our researchers find malware that is particular about where it infects. On the closed message boards used by Russian cybercriminals, for example, you sometimes see the advice \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t work with RU\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 offered by experienced criminals to the younger generation: i.e. don\xe2\x80\x99t infect Russian computers, don\xe2\x80\x99t steal money from Russians and don\xe2\x80\x99t use them to launder money. There are two good reasons for this. First, online banking is not as common as it is in the west. Second, victims outside Russia are unlikely to lodge a complaint with the Russian police \xe2\x80\x93 assuming, of course, that they even know that Russian cybercriminals are behind the malware that has infected them. But there are exceptions to every rule. One of these is the Lurk banking Trojan that has been used to steal money from victims in Russia for several years. The cybercriminals behind Lurk are interested in telecommunications companies, mass media and news aggregators and financial institutions. The first provide them with the means to transfer traffic to the attackers\xe2\x80\x99 servers. The news sites provide them with a way to infect a large number of victims in their \xe2\x80\x98target audience\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 i.e. the financial sector. The Trojan\xe2\x80\x99s targets appear to include Russia\xe2\x80\x99s four largest banks. The primary method used to spread the Lurk Trojan is drive-by download, using the Angler exploit pack: the attackers place a link on compromised websites that leads to a landing page containing the exploit. Exploits (including zero-days) are typically implemented in Angler before being used in other exploit packs, making it particularly dangerous. The attackers also distribute code through legitimate websites, where infected files are served to visitors from the .RU zone, but others receive clean files. The attackers use one infected computer in a corporate network as a bridgehead to spread across the organization. They use the legitimate PsExec utility to distribute the malware to other computers; and then use a mini-dropper to execute the Trojan\xe2\x80\x99s main module on the additional computers. In Q2 2016, @kaspersky #mobile security products detected 83,048 mobile #ransomware Trojans #KLreport Tweet There are a number of interesting features of the Lurk Trojan. One distinct feature, that we discussed soon after it first appeared , is that it is \xe2\x80\x98file-less\xe2\x80\x99 malware, i.e. it exists only in RAM and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t write its code to the hard drive. The Trojan is also set apart because it is highly targeted. The authors do their best to ensure that they infect victims that are of interest to them without catching the attention of analysts or researchers. The incidents known to us suggest Lurk is successful at what it was designed for: we regularly receive reports of thefts from online banking systems; and forensic investigations after the incidents reveal traces of Lurk on the affected computers. Malware stories Cybercriminals get ready for Rio Fraudsters are always on the lookout for opportunities to make money off the back of major sporting events, so it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an increase in cybercriminal activity related to the forthcoming Olympic Games in Brazil . We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an increase in spam e-mails. The spammers try to cash in on people\xe2\x80\x99s desire to watch the games live, sending out messages informing the recipient that they have won a (fake) lottery (supposedly organized by the International Olympic Committee and the Brazilian government): all they need to do to claim their tickets is to reply to the e-mail and provide some personal details. Some messages point to fake websites, like this one offering direct sale of tickets without the need to make an application to the official lottery: These fake ticketing sites are very convincing. Some fraudsters go the extra mile by obtaining legitimate SSL certificates to provide a secure connection between the victim\xe2\x80\x99s browser and the site \xe2\x80\x93 displaying \xe2\x80\x98https\xe2\x80\x99 in the browser address bar to lure victims into a false sense of security. The scammers inform their victims that they will receive their tickets two or three weeks before the event, so the victim doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become suspicious until it\xe2\x80\x99s too late and their card details have been used by the cybercriminals. Kaspersky Lab is constantly detecting and blocking new malicious domains, many of which include \xe2\x80\x98rio\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98rio2016\xe2\x80\x99 in the title. It\xe2\x80\x99s too late to buy tickets through official channels, so the best way to see the games is to watch on TV or online. We advise everyone to beware of malicious streaming websites \xe2\x80\x93 probably the last-ditch attempt by cybercriminals to scam people out of their money. Cybercriminals also take advantage of our desire to stay connected wherever we go \xe2\x80\x93 to share our pictures, to update our social network accounts, to find out the latest news or to locate the best places to eat, shop or stay. Unfortunately, mobile roaming charges can be very high, so often people look for the nearest Wi-Fi access point. This is dangerous, because data sent and received over an open Wi-Fi network can be intercepted. So passwords, PINs and other sensitive data can be stolen easily. On top of this, cybercriminals also install fake access points, configured to direct all traffic through a host that can be used to control it \xe2\x80\x93 even functioning as a \xe2\x80\x98man-in-the-middle\xe2\x80\x99 device that is able to intercept and read encrypted traffic. To gauge the extent of the problem, we drove by three major Rio 2016 locations and passively monitored the available Wi-Fi networks that visitors are most likely to try and use during their stay \xe2\x80\x93 the Brazilian Olympic Committee building, the Olympic Park and the Maracana, Maracanazinho and Engenhao stadiums. We were able to find around 4,500 unique access points. Most are suitable for multimedia streaming. But around a quarter of them are configured with weak encryption protocols: this means that attackers can use them to sniff the data of unsuspecting visitors that connect to them. To reduce your exposure, we would recommend any traveller (not just those who plan to visit Rio!) to use a VPN connection, so that data from your device travels to the Internet through an encrypted data channel. Be careful though. Some VPNs are vulnerable to DNS leak attacks \xe2\x80\x93 meaning that, although your immediate sensitive data is sent via the VPN, your DNS requests are sent in plain text to the DNS servers set by the access point hardware. This would allow an attacker to see what you\xe2\x80\x99re browsing and, if they have access to the compromised Wi-Fi network, define malicious DNS servers \xe2\x80\x93 i.e. letting them redirect you from a legitimate site (your bank, for example) to a malicious site. If your VPN provider doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support its own DNS servers, consider an alternative provider or a DNSCrypt service. There\xe2\x80\x99s one other thing that we need if we want to stay connected \xe2\x80\x93 electricity: we need to keep our mobile devices charged. Today you can find charging-points in shopping centres, airports and even taxis. Typically they provide connectors for leading phone models, as well as a USB connector that a visitor can use with their own cable. Some also provide a traditional power supply that can be used with a phone charger. But remember that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s connected to the other end of the USB connector. If an attacker compromises the charging-point, they can execute commands that allow them to obtain information about your device, including the model, IMEI number, phone number and more: information they can use to run a device-specific attack that would then enable them to infect the device. You can find more information about the data that\xe2\x80\x99s transmitted when you connect a device using USB and how an attacker could use it to compromise a mobile device . This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t charge your device when you\xe2\x80\x99re away from home. But you should take steps to protect yourself. It\xe2\x80\x99s always best to use your own charger, rather than using charging cables at a public charging-point or buying one from an unknown source. You should also use a power outlet, instead of a USB socket. Cybercriminals also continue to exploit established ways to make money. This includes using ATM skimmers to steal credit card data. The most basic skimmers install a card reader and a camera to record the victim\xe2\x80\x99s PIN. The best way to protect yourself from this is to cover the keypad as you enter your PIN. However, sometimes cybercriminals replace the whole ATM, including the keypad and screen, in which case the typed password is stored on the fake ATM system. So it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to check the ATM before you insert your card. Check to see if the green light on the card reader is on: typically, they replace the card reader with a version where there is no light, or it\xe2\x80\x99s switched off. Also check the machine to see if there is anything suspicious, such as missing or broken parts. Card cloning is another problem facing visitors to Rio 2016. While chip-and-PIN makes life harder for cybercriminals, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for them to exploit flaws in the EMV transaction implementation . It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to protect yourself against this type of attack, because usually the point-of-sale is modified in order to save the data \xe2\x80\x93 to be collected later by the cybercriminals. Sometimes they don\xe2\x80\x99t need physical access to extract the stolen data, as they collect it via Bluetooth. However, there are some steps you can take to reduce your exposure to this type of attack. Sign up for SMS notifications of card transactions from your bank, if they provide this service. Never give your card to the retailer: if they can\xe2\x80\x99t bring the machine to you, go to the machine. If the device looks suspicious, use a different payment method. Before typing your PIN, make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re on the card payment screen and ensure that your PIN isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be displayed on the screen. Ransomware: backup or pay up? Towards the end of last year, we predicted that ransomware would gain ground on banking Trojans \xe2\x80\x93 for the attackers, ransomware is easily monetized and involves a low cost per victim. So it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that ransomware attacks are increasing. Kaspersky Lab products blocked 2,315,931 ransomware attacks between April 2015 and April 2016 \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s an increase of 17.7 per cent on the previous year. The number of cryptors (as distinct from blockers) increased from 131,111 in 2014-15 to 718,536 in 2015-16. Last year, 31.6 per cent of all ransomware attacks were cryptors. You can find further information, including an overview of the development of ransomware, in our KSN Report: PC ransomware in 2014-16 . Most ransomware attacks are directed at consumers \xe2\x80\x93 6.8 per cent of attacks in 2014-15 and 13.13 percent in 2015-16 targeted the corporate sector. However, the figures are different for cryptors: throughout the 24 months covered by the report, around 20 per cent of cryptor attacks targeted the corporate sector. Hardly a month goes by without reports of ransomware attacks in the media \xe2\x80\x93 including recent reports of a hospital and online casino falling victim to ransomware attacks. Yet while public awareness of the problem is growing, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that consumers and organizations alike are not doing enough to combat the threat; and cybercriminals are capitalizing on this \xe2\x80\x93 this is clearly reflected in the number of attacks we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to reduce your exposure to ransomware (and we\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined important steps you can take here and here ). However, there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as 100 per cent security, so it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to mitigate the risk. In particular, it\xe2\x80\x99s vital to ensure that you have a backup, to avoid facing a situation where the only choices are to pay the cybercriminals or lose your data. It\xe2\x80\x99s never advisable to pay the ransom. Not only does this validate the cybercriminals\xe2\x80\x99 business model, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee that they will decrypt your data once you\xe2\x80\x99ve paid them \xe2\x80\x93 as one organization discovered recently to its cost . If you do find yourself in a situation where your files are encrypted and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a backup, ask if your anti-malware vendor is able to help. Kaspersky Lab, for example, is able to help recover data encrypted by some ransomware . Mobile malware Displaying adverts remains one of the main methods of monetization for detected mobile objects. Trojan.AndroidOS.Iop.c became the most popular mobile Trojan in Q2 2016, accounting for more than 10% of all detected mobile malware encountered by our users during the reporting period. It displays adverts and installs, usually secretly, various programs using superuser privileges. Such activity quickly renders the infected device virtually unusable due to the amount of adverts and new applications on it. Because this Trojan can gain superuser privileges, it is very difficult to delete the programs that it installs. In our report IT threat evolution in Q1 2016 we wrote about the Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Asacub family of banking malware. Representatives of this family have an unusual technique for bypassing the security mechanisms used by operating systems \xe2\x80\x93 they overlay the regular system window requesting device administrator privileges with their own window containing buttons. The Trojan thereby conceals the fact that it is gaining elevated privileges in the system, and tricks the user into approving these privileges. In Q2 2016, Asacub introduced yet another method for deceiving users: the Trojan acquired SMS messenger functionality and started offering its services in place of the device\xe2\x80\x99s standard SMS app. Dialog window of Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Asacub.i asking for the rights to be the main SMS application This allows the Trojan to bypass system constraints first introduced in Android 4.4 as well as delete or hide incoming SMSs from the user. Back in October 2015, we wrote about representatives of the Trojan-PSW.AndroidOS.MyVk family that steal passwords from user accounts on the VK.com social network. This quarter, those responsible for distributing Trojans from this family introduced a new approach for bypassing Google Play security mechanisms that involved first publishing an app containing useful functionality with no malicious code. Then, at least once, they updated it with a new version of the application \xe2\x80\x93 still without any malicious code. It was more than a month after the initial publication that the attackers eventually added malicious code to an update. As a result, thousands of users downloaded Trojan-PSW.AndroidOS.MyVk.i. Data breaches Personal information is a valuable commodity, so it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that cybercriminals target online providers, looking for ways to bulk-steal data in a single attack. We\xe2\x80\x99ve become accustomed to the steady stream of security breaches reported in the media. This quarter has been no exception, with reported attacks on beautifulpeople.com , the nulled.io hacker forum (underlining the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just legitimate systems that are targeted), kiddicare , Tumblr and others. Some of these attacks resulted in the theft of huge amounts of data, highlighting the fact that many companies are failing to take adequate steps to defend themselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s not simply a matter of defending the corporate perimeter. There\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as 100 per cent security, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not possible to guarantee that systems can\xe2\x80\x99t be breached. But any organization that holds personal data has a duty of care to secure it effectively. This includes hashing and salting customer passwords and encrypting other sensitive data. Consumers can limit the damage of a security breach at an online provider by ensuring that they choose passwords that are unique and complex: an ideal password is at least 15 characters long and consists of a mixture of letters, numbers and symbols from the entire keyboard. As an alternative, people can use a password manager application to handle all this for them automatically. Unfortunately, all too often people use easy-to-guess passwords and re-use the same password for multiple online accounts \xe2\x80\x93 so that if the password for one is compromised, all the victim\xe2\x80\x99s online IDs are vulnerable. This issue was highlighted publicly in May 2016 when a hacker known as \xe2\x80\x98Peace\xe2\x80\x99 attempted to sell 117 million LinkedIn e-mails and passwords that had been stolen some years earlier . More than one million of the stolen passwords were \xe2\x80\x98123456\xe2\x80\x99! Many online providers offer two-factor authentication \xe2\x80\x93 i.e. requiring customers to enter a code generated by a hardware token, or one sent to a mobile device, in order to access a site, or at least in order to make changes to account settings. Two-factor authentication certainly enhances security \xe2\x80\x93 if people choose to take advantage of it. Several companies are hoping to replace passwords altogether. Apple allows fingerprint authorization for iTunes purchases and payments using Apple Pay. Samsung has said it will introduce fingerprint, voice and iris recognition for Samsung Pay. Amazon has announced \xe2\x80\x98selfie-pay\xe2\x80\x99. MasterCard and HSBC have announced the introduction of facial and voice recognition to authorize transactions. The chief benefit, of course, is that it replaces something that customers have to remember (a password) with something they have \xe2\x80\x93 with no opportunity to short-circuit the process (as they do when they choose a weak password). Biometrics are seen by many as the way forward. However, they are not a security panacea. Biometrics can be spoofed, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed before ( here , here and here ); and biometric data can be stolen. In the end, multi-factor authentication is essential \xe2\x80\x93 combining something you know , something you have and something you are .

using CVE-2015-2545 Platinum (also known as TwoForOne) APT16 EvilPost SPIVY Danti and SVCMONDR Danti attacks Initial vector Exploit March attack March attack \xe2\x80\x93 payload SVCMONDR: the Taiwan case Conclusions Appendix A: EPS Objects their payload and http.exe trojan analysis EPS Objects Payload analysis Backdoor http.exe trojan Appendix B: Danti sample hashes Appendix C: sample hashes of SVCMONDR attacks    CVE-2015-2545 is a vulnerability discovered in 2015 and corrected with Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s update MS15-099. The vulnerability affects Microsoft Office versions 2007 SP3, 2010 SP2, 2013 SP1 and 2013 RT SP1.  The error enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted EPS image file. The exploit uses PostScript and can evade Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) protection methods.  The exploit was discovered in the wild in August 2015, when it was used in a targeted attack by the Platinum group , presumably against targets in India. Over the following months, there was significant growth in the number of threat actors using the vulnerability as a primary tool for initial penetration, with both the attack groups and their targets located in South-East and Central Asia and the Far East.  In this research paper, we discuss examples of attacks using the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability undertaken by some of these groups.  Overview of groups using CVE-2015-2545   Platinum (also known as TwoForOne)  The group is believe to originate from South-East Asia. Its attacks can be traced as far back as 2009. The group is notable for exploiting 0-day vulnerabilities and carrying out a small number of highly focused targeted attacks \xe2\x80\x93 mostly against government agencies in Malaysia, Indonesia, China and India.  This group was the first to exploit the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability. After the vulnerability was corrected with Microsoft updates in September and November 2015, no new Platinum attacks exploiting this vulnerability have been detected.  Microsoft presented the activity of this group at the SAS conference in February 2016, and in its paper: PLATINUM: Targeted attacks in South and Southeast Asia .  APT16  The group has been known for several years and is believed to be of Chinese origin. In November and December 2015, it used a modified exploit for CVE-2015-2545 in attacks against information and news agencies in Taiwan. These attacks were described in a FireEye research paper \xe2\x80\x93 The EPS Awakens \xe2\x80\x93 Part 2 .  EvilPost  In December 2015, Kaspersky Lab became aware of a targeted attack against the Japanese defense sector. In order to infect victims, the attacker sent an email with an attached DOCX file exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office using an embedded EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) object. The EPS object contained a shellcode that dropped and loaded a 32-bit or 64-bit DLL file depending on the system architecture. This, in turn exploited another vulnerability to elevate privileges to Local System (CVE-2015-1701) and download additional malware components from the C&C server.  The C&C server used in the attack was located in Japan and appears to have been compromised. However, there is no indication that it has ever been used for any other malicious purpose. Monitoring of the server activity for a period of several months did not result in any new findings. We believe the attackers either lost access to the server or realized that it resulted in too much attention from security researchers, as the attack was widely discussed by the Japanese security community.  According to our research partner in Japan, the original EvilPost attack in December 2015 arrived as a spear-phishing email with a Word document attached.  This document embedded an EPS object file, which triggered a vulnerability in the EPS format handler in Microsoft Word. Even with an exploit component, Microsoft Word rendered the document correctly and displayed the decoy message. The document is written in good Japanese, as shown below.   It has been used to decoy New Year impressions of defense-related organizations.  This attack was also described in the FireEye report , mentioned above.  An overview of the activity of the EvilPost group activity was provided to subscribers of the Kaspersky Lab Threat Intelligence Service in March 2016. For information about the service, please write to intelreports@kaspersky.com .  SPIVY  In March and April 2016, a series of emails laced with an exploit forCVE-2015-2545 were detected. The emails were sent in spear-phishing attacks, presumably targeting organizations in Hong Kong. Identifying a specific group behind these attacks is difficult because they used a new variant of a widely available backdoor known as PoisonIvy (from which the name of the group, SPIVY, is derived). A description of these incidents can be found in the PaloAlto blog .  Danti and SVCMONDR  These two groups have not yet been publicly described. An overview of their attacks and the tools used is provided in this report.   Danti attacks  Danti (Kaspersky Lab\xe2\x80\x99s internal name) is an APT actor that has been active at least since 2015, predominantly targeting Indian government organizations. According to our telemetry, Danti has also been actively hitting targets in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Nepal and the Philippines The group implemented a new campaign in February and March 2016, using a repurposed implementation of the CVE-2015-2545 exploit with custom shellcode. In order to infect the victim, the attackers distributed spear-phishing emails with an attached DOCX file exploiting the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The exploit is based on a malformed embedded EPS (Encapsulated Postscript) object. This contains the shellcode that drops a backdoor, providing full access to the attackers. Main findings:   Danti, a previously unknown group, is probably related to NetTraveller and DragonOK  In February-March 2016 the group was observed using CVE-2015-2545  It remains active, conducting attacks against Indian diplomatic organizations  Related attacks have been observed against Central and South East Asia targets   The campaign leveraging the exploit for CVE-2015-2545 took place in February 2016. As a result, several emails with attached DOCX files were uploaded to VirusTotal. The email recipients were connected to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, as can be seen below:  dsfsi@nic.in, the Foreign Service Institute, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Under Secretary (FT/NRG), dsfsi@mea.gov.in)  chumarpost@gmail.com, possibly related to the Chumar military post in India, a disputed area between India and China (the mail server is the same as the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs- vastuXX.nic.in)  chancery@indianembassy.hu, the Indian embassy in Hungary  amb.copenhagen@mea.gov.in, the Indian Embassy in Denmark  amb.bogota@mea.gov.in, the Indian embassy in Colombia  All these attacks took place between the 2 nd and 29 th of February, 2016.    Target and date  Attachment name  Sender    Indian embassy in Hungary 2 nd February  Mission List.doc  unknown (original email was forwarded)    Indian embassy in Denmark 2 nd February  HQ List.doc  mout.gmx.com ([74.208.4.200])    Indian embassy in Colombia 2 nd February  HQ List.doc  mout.gmx.com ([74.208.4.201])    DSFSI 24 th February  India\xe2\x80\x99s 10 Top Luxury Hotels.doc  191.96.111.195 via mout.gmx.com ([74.208.4.201])    Chumapost 29 th February  India\xe2\x80\x99s 10 Top Luxury Hotels.doc  43.227.113.129 via mout.gmx.com ([74.208.4.200])    In the case of the Indian Embassy in Hungary, it looks like the original message was forwarded from the embassy to the Indian IT security team in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and uploaded later to Virus Total. Initial vector The emails that were analysed had originally been sent via \xe2\x80\x9c3capp-mailcom-lxa06.server.lan\xe2\x80\x9d, perhaps using a spam-mailer program. In all known cases, the sender used the same gate at 74.208.4.200/74.208.4.201 (mout.gmx.com). The email messages changed for different waves of the campaign. When the campaign started in February 2 nd , the emails carried the subject headers \xe2\x80\x9cMission List\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHQ List\xe2\x80\x9d, and forged the identity of a real sender. Original message used in the first wave of attacks As can be seen above, the original email was supposedly forwarded from Anil Kumar Balani , Director of the Department of Information Technology at the Indian Ministry of Communications & Information Technology. Mission List decoy document At the same time, attackers sent a slightly different document with the subject \xe2\x80\x9cHQ List\xe2\x80\x9d to other Indian embassies (for example, those in Denmark and Colombia): Original HQ List email K.Nagaraj Naidu is Director of the Investments Technology Promotion Division in the Ministry of External Affairs, and a former Counsellor (T&C) at the Embassy of India in China. HQ List decoy document Both files (\xe2\x80\x9cMission List\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHQ list\xe2\x80\x9d) have different decoy content, but both use the same CVE-2015-2545 EPS exploit (image1.eps, MD5 a90a329335fa0af64d8394b28e0f86c1). Interestingly, as can be seen in their metadata, both files were modified by the user \xe2\x80\x9cIndia\xe2\x80\x9d on 01.02.2016, just one day before they were sent to targets.    \xe2\x80\x9cHQ List\xe2\x80\x9d metadata  \xe2\x80\x9cMission List\xe2\x80\x9d metadata            For the attacks at the end of February, the attackers decided to use the less relevant subject header of \xe2\x80\x9c10 top luxury hotels in India\xe2\x80\x9d, sent from an unknown sender. Top Luxury Hotels spear-phishing email This new attachment contains the same EPS exploit, but uses a different decoy document and a new payload. Top 10 Luxury Hotels decoy document The text of the document was copied from a Forbes article published in 2007. According to its metadata, the document was created in June 2015, so it has probably been used before in unknown attacks. However, the same mail gate (mout.gmx.com) was used as for the 2nd February attacks. Email header from February 29 Email header from February 24 All the \xe2\x80\x9cdoc\xe2\x80\x9d files are Web Archive Files and contain decoy documents and a malicious EPS. The structure of the WAF files is the same in all three cases: Web archive structure Exploit The attackers used at least one known 1-day exploit: the exploitforCVE-2015-2545 \xe2\x80\x93 EPS parsing vulnerability in EPSIMP32.FLT module, reported by FireEye, and patched by Microsoft on 8 September 2015 with MS15-099. We are currently aware of about four different variants of the exploit. The original one was used in August 2015 against targets in India by the Platinum (TwoForOne) APT group. Original EPS exploit, used in August 2015 The second (which is a modified variant of the original exploit) was used in EvilPost attacks against Japan in 2015, and then reused by cybercriminals in March 2016. This variant was also used by the APT16 group (ELMER backdoor) in Taiwan in December 2015. The second variant is easily recognized by the specific strings in its EPS shellcode: The \xe2\x80\x9ch:\\test.txt\xe2\x80\x9d string could have been forgotten by the exploit developer The third variant was used in December 2015 against a Taiwanese organization, and in February 2016 against an Indian diplomatic organization. This variant uses different shellcode but is based on the original exploit from the Platinum (TwoForOne) APT: Can be recognized by \xe2\x80\x9cadd2 <eb135\xe2\x80\x9d substring In the third variant, the binaries with the encrypted malicious exe file and the decoy document can be found at the end of the files. In the third variant, the binary starts with \xe2\x80\x9cPdPD\xe2\x80\x9d (50 64 50 44), a marker previously used for encrypted binaries by a number of APT groups (Anchor Panda, Samurai Panda, Temper Panda). Encrypted data at the end of the eps file The decryption function is 1-byte XOR with a key from \xe2\x80\x9cx00\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cxff\xe2\x80\x9d and replacement of the Odd byte for an Even byte in several hundred bytes from the header. Decrypted exe file Decrypted decoy document We detected a few different EPS objects in the exploit and these are analyzed below. The fourth variant of the exploit is analyzed in the \xe2\x80\x9cMarch attack\xe2\x80\x9d section. Read more about EPS objects and Payload in the Appendix. March attack At the end of March 2016, we discovered a new wave of attacks by the Danti group against Indian governmental institutions. On March 28 th several malicious document were sent to various recipients at the Cabinet Secretariat of Government India from the email account of Ms. Richa Gaharwar (<richa.gaharwar@nic.in>), Deputy Secretary at The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, the nodal agency of the Government of India. Email sent from the account of Ms. Richa Gaharwar The message was sent from an internal IP address using Oracle Communications Messenger. This could mean that the employee workstation used to send the malicious emails had been fully compromised. Email header The attachment contains the file \xe2\x80\x9cHolidays in India in 2016.docx\xe2\x80\x9d with the embedded EPS exploit. This time the attackers used the second variant of the exploit (previously used by the EvilPost and APT16 groups), with minor changes:  They removed the part with the \xe2\x80\x9ch:\\test.txt\xe2\x80\x9d strings  Dropped the binary added at the end of the EPS object (the same as in the third variant of the exploit)  Instead of using the \xe2\x80\x9cPdPD\xe2\x80\x9d string as a marker for binary, they used a new identifier: \xe2\x80\x9c1111111122222222\xe2\x80\x9d New identifier used All these changes created a new variant of the exploit, detected by very few antivirus products. The decoy document was created on January 27 th , and then modified by adding the EPS exploit on March 28 th , right before the attack. Decoy document According to its metadata, the document was created and modified by Chinese users: Decoy\xc2\xb4s metadata March attack \xe2\x80\x93 payload The dropped file is a RarSFX archive (331307 bytes). According to comments in the archive, this was also created by a Chinese user: The dropper installs four files in the system. The \xe2\x80\x9cAppinfo.dat\xe2\x80\x9d file launches \xe2\x80\x9cPotPlayerMini.exe\xe2\x80\x9d, monitors the memory periodically with the GlobalMemoryStatus API function and writes the results to \xe2\x80\x9cC:windowsmemstatus.txt\xe2\x80\x9d The main loader \xe2\x80\x9cPotPlayerMini.exe\xe2\x80\x9d is a legitimate multimedia player from Daum Communication . The file is signed with a legitimate signature from \xe2\x80\x9cDaum Communications Corp.\xe2\x80\x9d Digital signature information This legitimate file is used by the attackers to load a malicious, unsigned file from the same folder: PotPlayer.dll (the hardcoded PDB path inside is \xe2\x80\x9cC:UsersjohnDesktopPotPlayerReleasePotPlayer.pdb\xe2\x80\x9d). This, in turn executes appinfo.dat (the hardcoded PDB path inside is \xe2\x80\x9cD:BaiduYunDownloadServiceExeReleaseServiceExe.pdb\xe2\x80\x9d), which is a Yoda-compressed binary. The backdoor code is stored inside update.dat. The potplayer.dll \xe2\x80\x9cPreprocessCmdLineEx\xe2\x80\x9d export function:  Creates a service named \xe2\x80\x9cMemoryStatus\xe2\x80\x9d with a path to \xe2\x80\x9cappinfo.dat\xe2\x80\x9d file and sets it to HKEY_CURRENT_USER SoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun with the name \xe2\x80\x9cpotplayer\xe2\x80\x9d.  Opens \xe2\x80\x9cupdate.dat\xe2\x80\x9d file, decrypts it with xor operations and passes the execution to the result buffer.  \xe2\x80\x9cupdate.dat\xe2\x80\x9d, a backdoor: Makes its first GET request to hardcoded CnC \xe2\x80\x9cnewsupdate.dynssl.com/index.html\xe2\x80\x9d in order to get the new CnC in the response. If 407 response code is returned (Proxy authentication required) then the sample sends the request again with \xe2\x80\x9cproxyname\xe2\x80\x9d string as the proxy username and \xe2\x80\x9cproxypass\xe2\x80\x9d string as the proxy password. That suggests that may be the sample is compiled using some builder where these parameters must be set manually and in this specific sample were not changed from default. Finds \xe2\x80\x9c8FC628C9F43D42E2B77C2801518AF2A5\xe2\x80\x9d substring and decrypts it using AES CTR mode thrice using three 16-bytes keys. Makes a POST request to the new CnC with \xe2\x80\x9cim=validate\xe2\x80\x9d URL parameter and expects \xe2\x80\x9csuccess\xe2\x80\x9d string as the response. Forms the following structure in order to send to CnC in POST-request after AES encryption:  \xe2\x80\x9cCFB4CDE8-9285-4CC2-ACE2-CD9CCDF22C0D\xe2\x80\x9d string  Local IP  Host name  0x3E9 dword  OS version  SYSTEM_INFO structure  Decrypts the response using AES with one key.

SVCMONDR: the Taiwan case In December 2015, we uncovered another example of the type of shellcode found in the exploit for CVE-2015-2545. On 11 December, a spear-phishing email was sent by attackers to an employee of a Taiwanese security software reseller. Spear-phishing email The attachment contained a Web Archive File with \xe2\x80\x9c1-3\xe8\xaa\xaa\xe6\x98\x8e\xe6\xaa\x94.doc\xe2\x80\x9d and a malicious EPS file inside. \xe2\x80\x9c1-3\xe8\xaa\xaa\xe6\x98\x8e\xe6\xaa\x94.doc\xe2\x80\x9d This EPS (98c57aa9c7e3f90c4eb4afeba8128484) is exploit CVE-2015-2545 and contains an encrypted binary starting with \xe2\x80\x9cPdPD\xe2\x80\x9d (50 64 50 44), the same as seen in the Danti attacks. The structure of the Web Archive also carries references to the same files as the Danti group (with image002.gif and \xe2\x80\x9cimage002.eps\xe2\x80\x9d.) However, the files themselves are absent from the archive. Part of the Web Archive This resemblance could mean that we can attribute this case to the Danti group. However, it could also be a coincidence or yet another case of different groups using the same malicious code. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we are noting this incident separately from the Danti group\xe2\x80\x99s activity. Interestingly, in the first few days of December, another group \xe2\x80\x93 APT16 (FireEye\xe2\x80\x99s classification) also targeted Taiwan-based organizations with a CVE-2015-2545 EPS exploit, and its emails originated from the same domain as the one sent by the SVCMONDR attackers. However, it used another type of shellcode and a different backdoor \xe2\x80\x93 ELMER . After opening the doc file (which is again a Web Archive File), the exploit drops and executes the Trojan program \xe2\x80\x9csvcmondr.exe\xe2\x80\x9d (8052234dcd41a7d619acb0ec9636be0b). This queries the registry: \xe2\x80\x9cHKEY_USERSSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsConnectionsDefaultConnectionSettings\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternetSettingsConnectionsDefaultConnectionSettings\xe2\x80\x9d and compares the values. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t coincide, it sets the \xe2\x80\x9cDefaultConnectionSettings\xe2\x80\x9d value from the HKEY_USERS to HKCU key. It sets values taken from:  HKEY_USERSSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZones3 {A8A88C49-5EB2-4990-A1A2-0876022C854F}  HKEY_USERSSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZones3 {AEBA21FA-782A-4A90-978D-B72164C80120}  HKEY_USERSSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZones31A10  To the appropriate HKCU key (for example: HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZones3 {A8A88C49-5EB2-4990-A1A2-0876022C854F}, etc.). Then forms the structure in order to send it to the CnC in a POST-request with the following fields:  0x8888 constant  0x8000 constant  18-bytes hex string based on CoCreateGuid function  Local IP  MAC address  Example of POST request It encodes the resulting structure with base64. Example of a POST request: POST / HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32) Host: 59.188.13.204:9080 Content-Length: 112 Connection: Keep-Alive Cache-Control: no-cache AAAAAIiIAAAAgAAAAAAAAGQwNTRlYTkxMDAwMGEyZmU3NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMTAuNjMuMTIuNAAAAAAAADAwMEMyOUU5Nzg2QgAAAAAAAAAA Based on the CnC response, the sample:  Checks the password in the CnC response and compares it with the hardcoded password \xe2\x80\x9c1010\xe2\x80\x9d in its configuration structure. If the password is valid, it sets a \xe2\x80\x9ccertified\xe2\x80\x9d flag and can further process the following commands.  Launches given command line with ShellExecute, writes output results to %tmp% file, sends results to CnC and deletes the file.  Downloads file to %Temp% folder.  Uploads given file to CnC.  Sets sleep interval.  All results sent to the CnC after processing commands are encrypted with RC4 with a MAC-address as a key. The CnC points to an IP address in Hong Kong. This IP address belongs to a local private company, but falls within a range of IP addresses that belong to another enterprise that has already been identified as a host location for command and control servers that communicate with malware. The CnC has been used in other APT incidents, attributed by FireEye to the group \xe2\x80\x9cadmin@338\xe2\x80\x9d aka \xe2\x80\x9cTemper Panda\xe2\x80\x9d (59.188.0.197, accounts.serveftp.com). In general, this IP address space from \xe2\x80\x9cNew World Telecom HK\xe2\x80\x9d is one of the favorite places used by different Chinese-origin APT groups to host command & control servers/proxies. Another detail suggesting a possible relationship between SVCMONDR and Temper Panda is the use of the \xe2\x80\x9cPdPD\xe2\x80\x9d (50 64 50 44) marker for encrypted binaries. According to Crowdstrike, the same marker has been used previously by a number of APT groups (Anchor Panda, Samurai Panda and Temper Panda). The latest known activity of \xe2\x80\x9cadmin@338\xe2\x80\x9d was in August 2015, when it was used to target Hong Kong-based media using its own tools, LOWBALL and BUBBLEWRAP. However, we are unable to draw any conclusion regarding the relationship between the SVCMONDR group and Temper Panda. According to KSN data, in addition to Taiwan, there are some SVCMONDR victims in Thailand. Conclusions We are currently aware of at least four different APT actors actively using exploits of the CVE-2015-2545 vulnerability: TwoForOne (also known as Platinum), EvilPost, APT16 and Danti. These groups have their own toolsets of malicious program. Danti\xe2\x80\x99s arsenal is more extensive than those of EvilPost and APT16, and in terms of functionality can be compared with Platinum. All groups are focused on targets in the Asian region and have never been seen in incidents in Western Europe or the USA. The TwoForOne (Platinum) group is described in Microsoft research, APT16 in FireEye reports, and EvilPost and Danti in Kaspersky Lab private reports. Danti is highly focused on diplomatic entities. It may already have full access to internal networks in Indian government structures. According to Kaspersky Security Network, some Danti Trojans have also been detected in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Myanmar, Nepal and the Philippines. Despite the fact that Danti uses a 1-day exploit, the group is able to make its own modifications to bypass current antivirus detections. A number of the modules used by Danti have the same functionality as previously known and used malicious programs like NetTraveller and DragonOK. The use of CVE-2015-2545 exploits is on the rise. In addition to the groups mentioned above, we have seen numerous examples of these exploits being used by traditional cybercriminals in mass mailings in February-April 2016. Such attacks mostly target financial institutions in Asia. Specifically, attacks have been recorded in Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia. There are reasons to believe that Nigerian cybercriminals are behind these attacks. In some cases, the infrastructure used is the same as the one we saw when analyzing the Adwind Trojan. We expect to see more incidents with this exploit and we continue to monitor new waves of attacks and the potential relationship with other attacks in the region.
