APT17: Hiding in Plain\nSight - FireEye and Microsoft Expose Obfuscation Tactic     Threat actors have found a new way to\ndodge security professionals, using popular websites\xe2\x80\x99 legitimate\nfunctionalities to hide their hacking operations. FireEye Threat\nIntelligence and Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center discovered a\nChina-based threat group dubbed APT17 using Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s TechNet blog\nfor its Command-and-Control (CnC) operation.  Interestingly, APT17 chose not to\ncompromise TechNet, but rather created profiles and posted in forums\nto post its encoded CnC. Doing so made it more difficult for network\nsecurity professionals to determine the CnC\xe2\x80\x99s true location, which\nallowed APT17 to conduct its activities for longer than it might have otherwise.  This report details how we discovered the\noperation, what was done to shut it down, and how other threat groups\nhave already adopted a \xe2\x80\x9chide in plain sight\xe2\x80\x9d approach to hacking.  Download the report to find out:   Who APT17 is and who they\xe2\x80\x99re\ntargeting  How they bypassed traditional methods to avoid\ndetection  How this new method of compromise differs from\nprevious tactics  What FireEye and Microsoft did to shut\ndown APT17\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Microsoft TechNet blog   Download the report today.
