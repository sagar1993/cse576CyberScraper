May 21, 2015. 3:58 am      The MsnMM Campaigns [pdf]  For over half a decade, the Naikon APT waged multiple attack campaigns on sensitive targets throughout South-eastern Asia and around the South China Sea. It maintained a heavy offensive focus on Myanmar, Vietnam, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Laos. Targets and victims included ASEAN governmental agencies and government departments, investment enterprises, military, law enforcement and border control organizations, embassies, university faculties and others.  Parts of the campaigns have been publicly discussed\xc2\xa0according to the nature of their tools. For example, the MsnMM backdoors started out with internal names like \xe2\x80\x9cWinMM\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSslMM\xe2\x80\x9d, and their file naming spoofed MSN Talk and Msn Gaming Zone. The backdoor term \xe2\x80\x9cnaikon\xe2\x80\x9d was derived from the User-Agent string \xe2\x80\x9cNOKIAN95\xe2\x80\x9d. But msnMM, naikon, sakto, and rarstone backdoors are all used by the same actor that we call the Naikon APT. Their second stage tools largely remained unknown, but a list is included in this report.  The Naikon attackers attempted to exfiltrate sensitive geo-political, military, and economic data; to intercept communications and to maintain surveillance on their victims throughout the MsnMM campaigns. Their toolset and techniques changed over time in many minor ways, and appear to be run by Chinese-speaking individuals. The group\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure, reliant on web apps located mostly via dynamic dns domains, overlapped across these campaigns. As previously described, the APT\xe2\x80\x99s methods and technologies are simple, but highly effective against its targets\xe2\x80\x99 defenses. We do not find 0-days here.  Much of Naikon\xe2\x80\x99s spear-phish and decoy document content, as well as its deployment, coincided approximately with highly-charged geopolitical events. The consistent list of military, economic, and political targets gave away the actor\xe2\x80\x99s interests. Naikon\xe2\x80\x99s earliest campaigns deployed the exe_exchange, winMM, and sys10 backdoors, and the codebase was later built out into more custom tools. The MsnMM campaigns were waged into the start of 2014, and then dropped off before picking up again later in the year and into 2015.  Regarding interaction with other APTs, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to note that Naikon APT victims overlap with Cycldek APT victims. \xc2\xa0Cycldek is another persistent, but weaker APT. In addition, not only does the APT30 target profile match the Naikon APT, its toolset also features minor but noticeable similarities. And the later Naikon campaigns led to an all out APT v APT confrontation with the Hellsing APT , when \xe2\x80\x9cthe empire struck back.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although aspects of the malware set have been discussed on some blogs and in other papers, there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been an accurate report bringing together details of the MsnMM, Sys10, and Naikon campaigns as the work of one crew, the Naikon APT. Finally, while this report looks into their past activity, the Naikon APT remains active, deploying a more recent codebase. The top targets for 2015 that we are aware of include organizations in Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos.

Golovkin on May 14, 2015. 3:00 am      Our recent report, \xe2\x80\x9c The Chronicles of the Hellsing APT: the Empire Strikes Back \xe2\x80\x9d began with an introduction to the Naikon APT, describing it as \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the most active APTs in Asia, especially around the South China Sea\xe2\x80\x9d. Naikon was mentioned because of its role in what turned out to be a unique and surprising story about payback. It was a Naikon attack on a Hellsing-related organization that first introduced us to the Hellsing APT. \xc2\xa0Considering the volume of Naikon activity observed and its relentless, repeated attack attempts, such a confrontation was worth looking into, so we did.  The #NaikonAPT group was spear-phished by an actor we now call \xe2\x80\x9cHellsing\xe2\x80\x9d Tweet  The Naikon APT aligns with the actor our colleagues at FireEye recently revealed to be APT30 , but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t discovered any exact matches. It is hardly surprising that there is an element of overlap, considering both actors have for years mined victims in the South China Sea area, apparently in search of geo-political intelligence.  The #NaikonAPT group has for 5 years mined victims, apparently in search of geo-political intelligence Tweet  This Naikon report will be complemented by a follow-on report that will examine the Naikon TTP and the incredible volume of attack activity around the South China Sea that has been going on since at least 2010.  Noteworthy operational and logistical characteristics of this APT include:   At least five years of high volume, high profile, \xc2\xa0geo-political attack activity  Geographical\xc2\xa0 focus \xe2\x80\x93 per-country, individual operator assignment and proxy presence  Dynamic, well organized infrastructure  Reliance on an externally developed, consistent set of tools comprising a full-featured backdoor, a builder, and an exploit builder  High success rate in infiltrating national organisations in ASEAN countries   Highly Focused and Effective Around the South China Sea  In the spring of 2014, we noticed an increase in the volume of attack activity by the Naikon APT. The attackers appeared to be Chinese-speaking and targeted mainly top-level government agencies and civil and military organizations in countries such as the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, Nepal, Thailand, Laos and China.   Decoy  An attack typically starts with an email carrying an attachment that contains information of interest to the potential victim. The document may be based on information from open sources or on proprietary information stolen from other compromised systems.  This bait \xe2\x80\x9cdocument\xe2\x80\x9d, or email attachment, appears to be a standard Word document, but is in fact an CVE-2012-0158 exploit, an executable with a double extension, or an executable with an RTLO filename, so it can execute code without the user\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge or consent. When the executable is launched, spyware is installed on the victim computer at the same time as a decoy document is displayed to the user; fooling them into thinking they have simply opened a document.  Configuration  The Naikon tool of choice generates a special, small, encrypted file which is 8,000 bytes in size, containing code to be injected into the browser along with configuration data. With the help of a start-up module, this whole file is injected into the browser memory and decrypts the configuration block containing the following:   C&C server  Ports and path to the server  User-agent string  Filenames and paths to its components  Hash sums of the user API functions   The same code then downloads its main body from the C&C server using the SSL protocol, loads it independently from the operating system functions and, without saving it to the hard drive, hands over control to the XS02 function. All functionality is handled in memory.   Payload  The main module is a remote administration utility. Using SSL, the module establishes a reverse connection to the C&C server as follows: it sets up an outgoing connection to the C&C server and checks if there is a command that it should execute. If there is, it executes the command and returns the result to the C&C. There are 48 commands in the module\xe2\x80\x99s repertoire, which a remote operator can use to effectively control the victim computer. This includes taking a complete inventory, downloading and uploading data, installing add-on modules, or working with the command line.  The main module supports 48 commands, which the attackers can use to control the victim machine #NaikonAPT Tweet  Here is the complete list of commands:      0  CMD_MAIN_INFO    1  CMD_PROCESS_REFRESH    2  CMD_PROCESS_NAME    3  CMD_PROCESS_KILL    4  CMD_PROCESS_MODULE    5  CMD_DRIVE_REFRESH    6  CMD_DIRECTORY    7  CMD_DIRECTORY_CREATE    8  CMD_DIRECTORY_CREATE_HIDDEN    9  CMD_DIRECTORY_DELETE    10  CMD_DIRECTORY_RENAME    11  CMD_DIRECOTRY_DOWNLOAD    12  CMD_FILE_REFRESH    13  CMD_FILE_DELETE    14  CMD_FILE_RENAME    15  CMD_FILE_EXECUTE_NORMAL    16  CMD_FILE_EXECUTE_HIDDEN    17  CMD_FILE_EXECUTE_NORMAL_CMD    18  CMD_FILE_EXECUTE_HIDDEN_CMD    19  CMD_FILE_UPLOAD    20  CMD_FILE_DOWNLOAD    21  CMD_WINDOWS_INFO    22  CMD_WINDOWS_MESSAGE    23  CMD_SHELL_OPEN    24  CMD_SHELL_CLOSE    25  CMD_SHELL_WRITE    26  CMD_SERVICE_REFRESH    27  CMD_SERVICE_CONTROL    28  CMD_PROGRAM_INFO    29  CMD_UNINSTALL_PROGRAM    30  CMD_REGESTRY_INFO    31  CMD_ADD_AUTO_START    32  CMD_MY_PLUGIN    33  CMD_3RD_PLUGIN    34  CMD_REG_CREATEKEY    35  CMD_REG_DELETEKEY    36  CMD_REG_SETVALUE    37  CMD_REG_DELETEVALUE    38  CMD_SELF_KILL    39  CMD_SELF_RESTART    40  CMD_SELF_CONFIG    41  CMD_SELF_UPDATE    42  CMD_SERVER_INFO    43  CMD_INSTALL_SERVICE    44  CMD_FILE_DOWNLOAD2    45  CMD_RESET    46  CMD_CONNECTION_TABLE    50  CMD_HEART_BEAT      Several modifications of the main module exist. There are no fundamental differences between modifications; it\xe2\x80\x99s just that extra features get added to the latest versions, such as compression and encryption of transmitted data, or the piecemeal download of large files.      d085ba82824c1e61e93e113a705b8e9a  118272  Aug 23 18:46:57 2012    b4a8dc9eb26e727eafb6c8477963829c  140800  May 20 11:56:38 2013    172fd9cce78de38d8cbcad605e3d6675  118784  Jun 13 12:14:40 2013    d74a7e7a4de0da503472f1f051b68745  190464  Aug 19 05:30:12 2013    93e84075bef7a11832d9c5aa70135dc6  154624  Jan 07 04:39:43 2014      CC-Proxy-Op  C&C server operations are characterized by the following:   Low maintenance requirements  Organized geo-specific task assignments  Different approaches to communication   The C&C servers must have required only a few operators to manage the entire network. Each operator appears to have focused on their own particular set of targets, because a correlation exists between C&C and the location of targets/victims.  There is a geo-specific correlation between the location of #NaikonAPT C&Cs and that of targets/victims Tweet  Communication with victim systems changed depending on the target involved. In some cases, a direct connection was established between the victim computer and the C&C. In other cases, the connection was established via dedicated proxy servers installed on dedicated servers rented in third countries. In all likelihood, this additional setup was a reaction to the network administrators in some targets limiting or monitoring outbound network connections from their organizations.  Here is a partial list of C&C servers and victim locations, demonstrating the geo-specific correlation:      ID  Jakarta  linda.googlenow.in    ID  Jakarta  admin0805.gnway.net    ID  Jakarta  free.googlenow.in    ID   frankhere.oicp.net    ID  Bandung  frankhere.oicp.net    ID  Bandung  telcom.dhtu.info    ID  Jakarta  laotel08.vicp.net    JP  Tokyo  greensky27.vicp.net    KH   googlemm.vicp.net    KH  Phnom Penh  googlemm.vicp.net    MM   peacesyou.imwork.net    MM   sayakyaw.xicp.net    MM   ubaoyouxiang.gicp.net    MM  Yangon  htkg009.gicp.net    MM   kyawthumyin.xicp.net    MM   myanmartech.vicp.net    MM   test-user123.vicp.cc    MY   us.googlereader.pw    MY   net.googlereader.pw    MY   lovethai.vicp.net    MY   yahoo.goodns.in    MY  Putrajaya  xl.findmy.pw    MY  Putrajaya  xl.kevins.pw    PH  Caloocan  oraydns.googlesec.pw    PH  Caloocan  gov.yahoomail.pw    PH   pp.googledata.pw    PH   xl.findmy.pw    PH   mlfjcjssl.gicp.net    PH   o.wm.ggpw.pw    PH   oooppp.findmy.pw    PH   cipta.kevins.pw    PH   phi.yahoomail.pw    SG  Singapore  xl.findmy.pw    SG  Singapore  dd.googleoffice.in    VN  Hanoi  moziliafirefox.wicp.net    VN  Hanoi  bkav.imshop.in    VN  Hanoi  baomoi.coyo.eu    VN  Dong Ket  macstore.vicp.cc    VN  Hanoi  downloadwindows.imwork.net    VN  Hanoi  vietkey.xicp.net    VN  Hanoi  baomoi.vicp.cc    VN  Hanoi  downloadwindow.imwork.net    VN  Binh Duong  www.ttxvn.net    VN  Binh Duong  vietlex.gnway.net    VN  Hanoi  www.ttxvn.net    VN  Hanoi  us.googlereader.pw    VN  Hanoi  yahoo.goodns.in    VN  Hanoi  lovethai.vicp.net    VN  Hanoi  vietlex.gnway.net      XSControl \xe2\x80\x93 the Naikon APT\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvictim management software\xe2\x80\x9d  In the Naikon scheme, a C&C server can be specialized XSControl software running on the  host machine. It can be used to manage an entire network of infected clients. In some cases, a proxy is used to tunnel victim traffic to the XSControl server. A Naikon proxy server is a dedicated server that accepts incoming connections from victim computers and redirects them to the operator\xe2\x80\x99s C&C. An individual Naikon proxy server can be set up in any target country with traffic tunnelling from victim systems to the related C&C servers  XSControl is written in .NET with the use of DevExpress:    Its main capabilities are:   Accept initial connections from clients  Provide clients with the main remote administration module  Enable them to remotely administer infected computers with the help of a GUI  Keep logs of client activity  Keep logs of operator activity  Upload logs and files to an FTP server   The operator\xe2\x80\x99s activity logs contain the following:   An XML database of downloaded files, specifying the time of operation, the remote path and the local path  A database of file names, the victim computer registry keys for the folders and requested sections  A history of executed commands   Country X, Operator X  Now let\xe2\x80\x99s do an overview of one Naikon campaign, focusing on country \xe2\x80\x9cX\xe2\x80\x9d.  Analysis revealed that the cyber-espionage campaign against country X had been going on for many years. Computers infected with the remote control modules provided attackers with access to employees\xe2\x80\x99 corporate email and internal resources, and access to personal and corporate email content hosted on external services.  Below is a partial list of organizations affected by Naikon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coperator X\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d espionage campaign in country X.   Office of the President  Military Forces  Office of the Cabinet Secretary  National Security Council  Office of the Solicitor General  Intelligence Services  Civil Aviation Authority  Department of Justice  Federal Police  Executive/Presidential Administration and Management Staff   A few of these organizations were key targets and under continuous, real-time monitoring. It was during operator X\xe2\x80\x99s network monitoring that the attackers placed Naikon proxies within the countries\xe2\x80\x99 borders, to cloak and support real-time outbound connections and data exfiltration from high-profile victim organizations.  In order to obtain employees\xe2\x80\x99 credentials, operator X sometimes used keyloggers. If necessary, operator X delivered them via the remote control client. In addition to stealing keystrokes, this attacker also intercepted network traffic. Lateral movements included copying over and remotely setting up winpcap across desktop systems within sensitive office networks, then remotely setting up AT jobs to run these network sniffers. Some APTs like Naikon distribute tools such as these across multiple systems in order to regain control if it is lost accidentally and to maintain persistence.  The #NaikonAPT group took advantage of cultural idiosyncrasies in its target countries Tweet  Operator X also took advantage of cultural idiosyncrasies in its target countries, for example, the regular and widely accepted use of personal Gmail accounts for work. So it was not difficult for the Naikon APT to register similar-looking email addresses and to spear-phish targets with attachments, links to sites serving malware, and links to google drive.  The empire strikes back  Every once in a while the Naikon group clashes with other APT groups that are also active in the region. In particular, we noticed that the Naikon group was spear-phished by an actor we now call \xe2\x80\x9cHellsing\xe2\x80\x9d.
