0,APT15,"APT Attackers Target Japanese Word Processor Zero-Day
Symantec has issued an alert to warn organizations about targeted attacks against a previously undocumented security hole in Ichitaro, a word processing software program used by central and local governments as well as educational institutions in Japan. 
Justsystems, the company that markets the Ichitaro software, has confirmed the issue and warns that live attacks are leading to full remote system compromise. 
According to a post on the Symantec Security Response blog, the attacks may be linked to the APT 12 group that successfully hacked into the New York Times earlier this year. 
 Symantec said it first spotted attempts to exploit the Ichitaro vulnerability in September 2013. 
""Our analysis revealed that the samples, detected as Trojan.Mdropper, for these attacks all contained the same back door Trojan, which Symantec detected as Backdoor.Vidgrab. If the exploit is successful, in theory the shell code would be executed to drop and launch the simplified Chinese version of notepad.exe while compromising the system, with the back door connecting to a remote site,"" Symantec warned. 
 The company noted that the identical backdoor variant was used as a payload for a watering hole attack that hit a Microsoft Internet Explorer vulnerability which was patched in October 2013. 
 The research team is speculating that the same malware group is using vulnerabilities in multiple software to launch APT attacks. 
""[This backdoor] is known to be used to target the Asia-Pacific region with government sectors being the primary targets according to Trend Micro. Symantec telemetries do not dispute this claim,"" the company said. 
 In the latest Ichitaro attacks, Symantec says the Trojan is delivered as e-mail attachments with Ichataro's .jtd file extension. However, the malicious files are actually rich text format files that cannot be opened using Microsoft Word as they are designed to work only with Ichitaro. 
 ""An interesting point of this attack campaign is that the malware group used unusual subject lines and email content that are not commonly used in targeted attacks,"" Symantec said. 
This is a classic spear-phishing attack that attempts to lure the targets to a popular Japanese online shopping site. If the target opens the file, the zero-day vulnerability is exploited and malware is placed on the machine that attempts to connect to a web site associated with the APT 12 group. 
Security researchers are noticing a spike in advanced attacks against Japanese targets. Earlier this year, Kaspersky Lab warned about the Icefog cyber-espionage campaign that targeted governmental institutions, military contractors, maritime and ship-building groups, telecom operators, satellite operators, industrial and high technology companies and mass media, mainly in South Korea and Japan.

1,APT15,"China-Linked Spies Used New Malware in U.K. Government Attack
A known cyber espionage group believed to be operating out of China was last year spotted using new malware in an attack aimed at an organization that provides services to the U.K. government.
Details about the attack were presented last week at Kaspersky’s Security Analyst Summit (SAS) in Cancun by Ahmed Zaki, senior malware researcher at NCC Group.
The attack has been attributed to a threat actor known as APT15, Ke3chang, Mirage, Vixen Panda and Playful Dragon. NCC Group started analyzing the group’s recent activities after it targeted one of its customers, a global company that provides a wide range of services to the United Kingdom government.
Researchers believe the attackers had been targeting various U.K. government departments and military technology through its customer. NCC has not made any statements regarding attribution, but Zaki did mention during his presentation at SAS that APT15 was particularly active during hours that correspond to working hours in East Asia.
APT15 has been active since at least 2010 and it has targeted organizations all around the world using its own malware and Word, Adobe Reader and Java exploits. The group has improved its tools and techniques over the years, and NCC recently spotted two new backdoors it created.
One of the backdoors has been dubbed RoyalCLI and is considered a successor of BS2005, a piece of malware that is often used by the group. RoyalCLI leverages similar encryption and encoding routines, and they both communicate with command and control (C&C) servers via Internet Explorer using the IWebBrowser2 interface.
The malware uses the Windows command prompt (cmd.exe) to execute a majority of its commands. It’s designed to copy the cmd.exe file and modify it, which allows it to bypass policies that might prevent the command prompt from running on the targeted device.  
The second backdoor, named RoyalDNS, uses DNS, specifically TXT records, to communicate with the C&C server. This piece of malware receives commands, executes them, and returns output through DNS.
In the case of the attack analyzed by NCC, the hackers compromised more than 30 hosts, with forensic artifacts showing that the initial intrusion may have occurred as early as May 2016. NCC was asked by the client to stop its investigation in June 2017, but resumed it in August after the threat actor managed to regain access to the victim’s network. Experts determined that the hackers had stolen a VPN certificate from a compromised host and used it to regain access via the corporate VPN.

The commands sent by the attackers to the RoyalCLI and BS2005 malware were cached to the disk of compromised devices, allowing researchers to recover over 200 commands. Since one of the commands contained a typo, investigators determined that they were likely sent by a human operative rather than an automated process.
In addition to BS2005, RoyalCLI and RoyalDNS, APT15 used custom-built keyloggers, and Microsoft SharePoint and Exchange enumeration and data dumping tools. The group’s arsenal also includes widely available tools such as Mimikatz, CSVDE, NetEnum, and RemoteExec.
Moreover, the attackers relied on various Windows commands to conduct reconnaissance, including tasklist, ping, netstat, net, systeminfo, ipconfig and bcp. For lateral movement they leveraged the net command and manually copied files to and from compromised hosts.
“Through our investigation we were able to identify and monitor the attack process from start to finish, offering us unique insight into the behaviour of this group,” Zaki said. “It’s clear to see that this is a highly sophisticated threat actor that has no problem writing tools which are specific to its victims.”
