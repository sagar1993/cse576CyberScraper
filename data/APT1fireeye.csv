In the realm of cybersecurity, 2013 was a memorable year not for breaches, but for tectonic-level shifts that completely changed how we perceive cybersecurity and its impact on how we run our businesses, how our leaders govern, and more importantly, how we understand national security.  In other words, for those in the C-Suite, technical issues were tangible business problems. This was highlighted by our APT1 report and the growing awareness that cybersecurity threats aren\'t just irritating, they severely impact an organization\'s bottom line.  In case you missed some of our most read posts, here is a list that will give you insight into what content was top of mind with our Suite Spot M-Unition readers:  Mandiant Exposes APT1 - One of China\'s Cyber Espionage Units & Releases 3,000 Indicators  The Mandiant\xc2\xae Intelligence Center\xe2\x84\xa2 released an unprecedented report exposing APT1\xe2\x80\xb2s multi-year, enterprise-scale computer espionage campaign. APT1 is one of dozens of threat groups Mandiant tracks around the world and we consider it to be one of the most prolific in terms of the sheer quantity of information it has stolen.  Chinese Leadership Change and the Advanced Persistent Threat  We at Mandiant have considered the strategic impact of the Chinese change in leadership and its impact on Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups and the current cyber espionage campaign that has been traced back to the PRC. We have determined that the new leaders will only enhance the influence that the People\'s Liberation Army (PLA), State Owned Enterprises (SOE), and national-level central planning initiatives have already had in contributing to an environment which produces and nurtures APT.  APT1 Three Months Later - Significantly Impacted, Though Active & Rebuilding  Three months later, Mandiant has observed a decrease in APT1\'s operations. However, we can confirm that APT1 continues cyber espionage operations against targeted computer networks. While Mandiant\'s APT1 report seems to have affected APT1 operations, APT1 is still active using a well-coordinated and well-defined attack methodology against a wide set of industries - with a discernible post-report shift towards new tools and infrastructure.  Richard Bejtlich on His Latest Book, ""The Practice of Network Security Monitoring""  Everyone wants to know how to find intruders on their networks. In this post, Richard Bejtlich writes about his first experiences learning to find intruders when he served in the Air Force Computer Emergency Response Team (AFCERT). These experiences spurred the decision to start writing books and to share his knowledge with the information security community. He also previews his latest book, ""The Practice of Network Security Monitoring.""

We are excited to see people using our data, both for online research and for their network defense. In this post we want to highlight and summarize information that others have discovered.  1. The phone number used by the APT1 DOTA persona was also a contact phone number for an apartment rental advertisement in 2009. This apartment is 600 meters away from the Unit 61398 headquarters building and further links the DOTA persona to that location.  Chinese-speaking netizens disclosed on Twitter that the phone number we associated with DOTA (159-2193-7229) was also the contact phone number listed at http://shanghai.favolist.com/05953558.shtml . This page is a rental advertisement dated 2009-10-09 and shown in Figure 1 with the phone number underlined. Figure 2 is an English translation of the advertisement title and body.  Figure 1: Rental advertisement at http://shanghai.favolist.com/05953558.shtml Figure 2: Translation of the rental advertisement at http://shanghai.favolist.com/05953558.shtml The apartment complex name, Yixinyuan (\xe6\x80\xa1\xe5\xbf\x83\xe8\x8b\x91), the location Waigaoqiao, and the description ""about a 10-minute walk away from Gangcheng Road subway station"" together pinpoint the apartment complex to be at Huashan Road 609 Long, Pudong, Shanghai, China, according to the Yixinyuan website at http://yixinyuan021.soufun.com . This apartment complex is only a 600-meter walk away from the Unit 61398 headquarters building, as depicted in Figure 3.  Figure 3: Walking directions from Yixinyuan apartment complex to Unit 61398 headquarters We observed DOTA/APT1 using the phone number in June 2011 and again in September 2011, showing that the number was not a simple ""throw-away"" number registered for one-time use. The date of the advertisement and the date we observed DOTA using the phone number are separated by over one and a half years. It is plausible that DOTA (or someone in APT1) worked for Unit 61398, lived in the Yixinyuan apartment complex and wrote this advertisement.[1] The remaining possibilities seem significantly less likely, including:   The phone number did not belong to APT1 in 2009, and it is a coincidence that the user of the phone at the time was associated with an apartment so close to Unit 61398.  A member of APT1 lived 600 meters from Unit 61398, but APT1 is not Unit 61398.  APT1 is not operating in Pudong but is intentionally trying to frame Unit 61398 or a Pudong-based organization. In 2011, someone in APT1 saw the rental advertisement from 2009 and configured a phone to successfully accept text messages to the phone number in the advertisement on multiple occasions.   2. The APT1 SuperHard persona may have been a student at the PLA\'s Information Engineering University, one of the Chinese military\'s premier training grounds for computer network operations.  On his blog, Cyb3rsleuth disclosed a person using the username ""Superhard_M"" and the email address mei_qiang_82@hotmail.com. In a job profile, this person ""mentions that his interests are network security and developing hacking tools."" This person\'s address in 2005 was listed as ""Henan Zhengzhou 1001 mailbox 774"". Cyb3rsleuth noted this address ""belongs to the famous PLA Information Engineering University [and] implies he was a student at PLAIEU.""[2] Furthermore, a person named Mei Qiang (\xe6\xa2\x85\xe5\xbc\xba) co-authored two papers in 2007 and 2008 that are associated with the PLAIEU. The papers are titled ""HTTP Session Hijacking on Switch LAN and Its Countermeasures"" and ""Stack Protection Mechanisms in Windows Vista"". In a 2012 report prepared for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Northrop Grumman analysts noted, ""The PLA Information Engineering University (PLAIEU), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, is perhaps the military university with the most comprehensive involvement in information warfare and computer network operations training, planning, and possibly also execution."" This information is consistent with the APT1 SuperHard persona, and given SuperHard\'s development skills, it would not be surprising if SuperHard was trained at the PLAIEU.  3. The APT1 UglyGorilla persona may have been a student at Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2004.  Cyb3rsleuth also disclosed that a person with the username ""uglygorilla"" was logged as ""on station 2 times"" by the Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU) bulletin board system in August 2004. This person logged in from the Shanghai IP address 210.22.114.46. Other people may use the name ""uglygorilla"" and this may not be the APT1 UglyGorilla persona. However, if it is, it would indicate that he was probably a student at SJTU when he posed his question about Chinese cyber troops to Zhang Zhaozhong.  4. In 2004, Unit 61398 was located in Pudong, Shanghai and was recruiting computer science students from Zhejiang University.  An article published in the China Digital Times disclosed a 2004 recruitment notice on the Zhejiang University website advertising, ""Unit 61398 of China\'s People\'s Liberation Army (located in Pudong District, Shanghai) seeks to recruit 2003-class computer science graduate students."" This corroborates our assertions concerning the kinds of personnel that Unit 61398 recruits. This also indicates Unit 61398 has been operating in Pudong since 2004, even though the current headquarters facility was not built and operational until years later.  Finally, our thanks to Wendy Nather, who expanded on our Occam\'s Razor arguments in her Idoneous Security blog. We appreciated the entire blog post, but especially these closing words:    From what Mandiant has presented, the simplest explanation is the one it\'s offering. It\'s politically explosive, of course, and that\'s why belief comes into play. But if you have to do more work to deny something than to accept it, you might want to reconsider your chain of logic.    [1] We are aware Marketplace reported that they called the phone number and reached someone unaffiliated with Unit 61398 or hacking activities. Marketplace said in the podcast that they called the number that the narrator said. This is when we discovered an unfortunate typo in the video narration script, which read ""7729"" instead of ""7229"" that was on the screen. The number was correctly published as ""7229"" in our main report.   [2] The link between the PLAIEU and this address seems to be corroborated in this paper: http://file.lw23.com/6/60/607/6071f3f4-40e6-4c7b-8868-3b0b21a9f601.pdf          This entry was posted on Wed Feb 27 19:00 EST 2013 and filed under Apt1 , Cyber Espionage , Malware Analysis , Intel Team , Targeted Attacks , China Cybercrime , Advanced\nPersistent Threat , and APT .

APT1 Three Months Later \xe2\x80\x93 Significantly Impacted, Though Active & Rebuilding   May 21, 2013  |  by Dan McWhorter     On 18 February 2013, Mandiant released a report exposing one of China\'s cyber espionage units. The group, which Mandiant calls APT1, is one of the most prolific we track in terms of the sheer quantity of information it has stolen. The scale and impact of APT1\xe2\x80\xb2s operations compelled us to write the report and release more than 3,000 Indicators to help organizations defend against APT1\'s tactics. The report linked APT1 to a unit within China\'s People\'s Liberation Army and received widespread attention from the media and from the U.S. government.  Three months later, Mandiant has observed a decrease in APT1\'s operations. However, we can confirm that APT1 continues cyber espionage operations against targeted computer networks. While Mandiant\'s APT1 report seems to have affected APT1 operations, APT1 is still active using a well-coordinated and well-defined attack methodology against a wide set of industries -- with a discernible post-report shift towards new tools and infrastructure.  Mandiant\'s report and the simultaneous release of 3,000+ indicators hindered APT1\'s operations by causing the group to retool and change some operational methodology. Since the report, APT1 has stopped using the vast majority of the infrastructure that was disclosed with the release of the indicators. However, APT1 maintained an extensive infrastructure of computer systems around the world, and it is highly likely that APT1 still maintains access to those systems or has utilized those systems to establish new attack infrastructure in the last three months.  One thing that has not changed is the activity level of many of the 20+ Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups of suspected Chinese origin that Mandiant tracks. These groups are still very active and Mandiant has observed no significant changes in their operations after the release of the APT1 report. These groups also conduct cyber espionage campaigns against a broad range of victims and, based on Mandiant\'s observations, they were not directly affected by the release of the Mandiant APT1 report.  The discovery and attribution of APT1 to China\'s 2nd Bureau of the People\'s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department\'s (GSD) 3rd Department (Military Unit Cover Designator 61398) also elevated the public dialogue about cyber espionage and the theft of intellectual property to a level not seen before. President Obama\'s National Security Advisor, Thomas Donilon, said that cyber espionage has moved to the ""forefront"" of the US agenda in its relationship with China and called for the Chinese Government to stop the hacking and to join an international process for limiting economic espionage.  Congress is taking action as well. Earlier this month, Senators Levin, McCain, Coburn and Rockefeller introduced S. 884, the Deter Cyber Theft Act , which would require the Government to publish an annual report listing foreign countries that engage in economic espionage and block imports from those countries made with stolen technologies. This bill is designed to be that next step not only to ""name and shame"" the bad actors but also to punish them economically.  The subject of Chinese attacks, such as those conducted by APT1, seems poised to stay front and center on the diplomatic agenda where, according to the New York Times , it will be a ""central issue in an upcoming visit to China by President Obama\'s national security adviser, Thomas Donilon.""

Recently, FireEye COO, Kevin Mandia took the stage at RSA USA 2014 to take a look back and share his perspective on the activities that led to the release of the APT1 report and the aftermath. While the initial report caused a media frenzy, unquestionably, the most important part of the story is the aftermath. Mandiant released the report to elevate the dialogue and address the frustration of organizations that were throwing money at cybersecurity problems and still facing attacks.

Mandiant Exposes APT1 \xe2\x80\x93 One of China\'s Cyber Espionage Units &\nReleases 3,000 Indicators   February 19, 2013  |  by Dan McWhorter     Today, The Mandiant\xc2\xae Intelligence Center\xe2\x84\xa2 released an unprecedented report exposing APT1\'s multi-year, enterprise-scale computer espionage campaign. APT1 is one of dozens of threat groups Mandiant tracks around the world and we consider it to be one of the most prolific in terms of the sheer quantity of information it has stolen.  Highlights of the report include:   Evidence linking APT1 to China\'s 2nd Bureau of the People\'s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department\'s (GSD) 3rd Department (Military Cover Designator 61398).  A timeline of APT1 economic espionage conducted since 2006 against 141 victims across multiple industries.  APT1\'s modus operandi (tools, tactics, procedures) including a compilation of videos showing actual APT1 activity.  The timeline and details of over 40 APT1 malware families.  The timeline and details of APT1\'s extensive attack infrastructure.   Mandiant is also releasing a digital appendix with more than 3,000 indicators to bolster defenses against APT1 operations. This appendix includes:   Digital delivery of over 3,000 APT1 indicators, such as domain names, and MD5 hashes of malware.  Thirteen (13) X.509 encryption certificates used by APT1.  A set of APT1 Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and detailed descriptions of over 40 malware families in APT1\'s arsenal of digital weapons.  IOCs that can be used in conjunction with Redline \xe2\x84\xa2, Mandiant\'s free host-based investigative tool, or with Mandiant Intelligent Response\xc2\xae (MIR) , Mandiant\'s commercial enterprise investigative tool.   The scale and impact of APT1\'s operations compelled us to write this report. The decision to publish a significant part of our intelligence about Unit 61398 was a painstaking one. What started as a ""what if"" discussion about our traditional non-disclosure policy quickly turned into the realization that the positive impact resulting from our decision to expose APT1 outweighed the risk of losing much of our ability to collect intelligence on this particular APT group. It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating from China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat the threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in the public\'s understanding of the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches.  We recognize that no one entity can understand the entire complex picture that many years of intense cyber espionage by a single group creates. We look forward to seeing the surge of data and conversations a report like this will likely generate.

Threat Actors Using Mandiant APT1 Report as a Spear Phishing Lure: The\nNitty Gritty   February 22, 2013  |  by Carrie Jung     As we noted yesterday , Brandon Dixon\'s 9B+ blog and Symantec reported the discovery of two malicious versions of our APT1 report. We wanted to provide follow-on details based on our analysis of these samples. Additionally, we have attached Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) so folks can begin using them to detect the malware.  PDF1 - ""Mandiant_APT2_Report"" Lure  MD5: 14A6E24977FF6E7E8A8661AADFA1A1F3  This is a password protected PDF using the password ""hello"" and exploits the CVE-2011-2462 vulnerability from back in December of 2011. Once opened it drops %TEMP% AdobeArm.tmp (4D9A1144E08E7FAE7D6DB8BC606F5BE5) and %TEMP% Mandiant_APT2_Report.pdf (29E9494E2EBA1D8F8AD9EE308FFE53EF). The newly dropped report is opened and the AdobeArm.tmp binary is executed.  The AdobeArm.tmp malware is a variant of the Bisrala downloader Trojan outlined here: http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2011-061607-2451-99&tabid=2 . The malware can download and execute additional malware, list processes and files, load additional DLLs, and overwrite system files. The malware executes its main functionality from an embedded shellcode payload.  Before executing its payload the malware creates a thread that will monitor for windows created containing text related to AVG firewall notifications. The malware attempts to dismiss these notifications by selecting the button that will add an exception for this connection in the AVG firewall. The malware then extracts its main payload and initially decodes it using a single byte XOR key of 0x99 . An additional buffer is then decoded within the decoded shellcode using a single byte XOR key of 0xFF . Throughout execution, shellcode and configuration data are re-encoded to prevent the malware from being fully decoded in memory. This buffer contains configuration data that will be used later by the malware and is shown below.  Figure 1: Decoded configuration data The malware\'s main payload is implemented using multiple shellcode buffers that are decoded and re-encoded throughout their execution. The malware then attempts to load the following DLLs and call an exported function from each which are listed below:   The malware attempts to load the DLL named %SYSTEMROOT% system32appmgmt.dll and calls an exported function named dll .  The malware attempts to load the DLL named %SYSTEMROOT% system32PurpleTrans.dll and calls an exported function named RealWork .   The malware copies its embedded configuration data to a file named %TEMP% winbha.dat that is used to store additional configuration information encoded with a large XOR key. The malware then attempts to connect to the configured server at itsec.eicp.net using TCP port 443 to download files to the infected system.  Other indicators include:   It creates the following mutexes: ""0x1A7B4C9F"" and ""0123456AB""  Creates the registry key: HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRunLoad: %TEMP% AdobeArm.tmp   PDF2 - Japanese email reported by Symantec  MD5: 2A42BF17393C3CAAA663A6D1DADE9C93  The second PDF appears to be targeting Japanese entities, as identified by Symantec. The PDF exploits the CVE-2013-0641 vulnerability in Adobe Reader. This causes the PDF to drop the file %TEMP% D.T (CB33E97F46A219804DDB373FF982D694). The binary has already been discussed previously at http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/new-adobe-pdf-zero-day-unleashes-trojanswaylib . D.T is responsible for decrypting and dropping the next piece at %TEMP% L2P.T (A7310E731271BBB98FF09818E06f4A4D), loading and executing L2P.T and displaying the following message box:  Figure 2: Message box displayed by the D.T DLL loaded within Adobe Reader The L2P.T that is executed is different from what was previously described elsewhere. It drops a clean PDF at %TEMP% Adobe Reader.pdf (44374BE2AEAA7E46DEFE3DA50569EB9E) and a malicious binary at %TEMP% AdobeARM.exe (41915B34FC50FFDD2A6A0969E3F55FF1). The clean PDF is then displayed for the user while AdobeARM.exe is executed in the background.  AdobeARM.exe first copies itself to C:Documents and SettingsAll UsersDocumentsMy MusicAcroRd32Info.exe and then points the following Run key to its new copy: HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRunShStatEXE . At this point AdobeARM.exe has the ability to communicate out to several different servers on port 80. The GET request URIs are created by using the hostname along with the language ID of the infected system. The malware takes the hostname string (up to 0x14 characters), increments each character by one and then appends the language ID string. Potential servers and URI\'s include:  Figure 3: Servers and URI\'s hardcoded in AdobeARM.exe If successful, the malware downloads data to %TEMP% mp .dat . The data received is encrypted using RC4 where the key is seeded with the string "" http://.www. "" repeated for a total of 256 characters. After the received data is decrypted, the malware verifies that it begins with ""MZ"" and then executes the binary. The malware sleeps for 15 minutes before it tries to connect out again.

The PLA and the 8:00am-5:00pm Work Day: FireEye Confirms DOJ\'s Findings\non APT1 Intrusion Activity   May 20, 2014  |  by Fireeye Labs     Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced the indictment of five members of the Second Bureau of the People\xe2\x80\x99s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department\xe2\x80\x99s Third Department, also known as PLA Unit 61398.\xc2\xa0 This is the same unit that Mandiant publicly unmasked last year in the APT1 report . At the time it was originally released, China denounced the report, saying that it lacked sufficient evidence . Following the DOJ\xe2\x80\x99s indictment, however, China\xe2\x80\x99s usual response changed from \xe2\x80\x9cyou lack sufficient evidence\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9c you have fabricated the evidence \xe2\x80\x9d, calling on the U.S. to \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect the error immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d This is a significant evolution in China\xe2\x80\x99s messaging; if the evidence is real, it overwhelmingly demonstrates China\'s unilateral attempts to leapfrog years of industrial development -- by using cyber intrusions to access and steal intellectual property. The evidence provided in the indictment includes Exhibit F (pages 54-56), which shows three charts based on Dynamic DNS data. These charts indicate that the named defendants (Unit 61398 members) were re-pointing their domain names at a Dynamic DNS provider during Chinese business hours from 2008 to 2013. The China work day, particularly for government offices, is very predictable, as noted on this travel site : ""Government offices, institutions and schools begin at 8:00 or 8:30, and end at 17:00 or 17:30 with two-hour noon break, from Monday to Friday. They usually close on Saturday, Sunday and public holidays."" What Exhibit F shows is a spike of activity on Monday through Friday around 8am in Shanghai (China Standard Time), a roughly 2-hour lull at lunchtime, and then another spike of activity from about 2pm to 6pm. The charts also show that there were very few changes in Dynamic DNS resolution on weekends. At Mandiant (now a FireEye company), we can corroborate the DOJ\xe2\x80\x99s data by releasing additional evidence that we did not include in the APT1 report. In the APT1 report, we specified the following: Over a two-year period (January 2011 to January 2013) we confirmed 1,905 instances of APT1 actors logging into their hop infrastructure from 832 different IP addresses with Remote Desktop. Of the 832 IP addresses, 817 (98.2%) were Chinese and belong predominantly to four large net blocks in Shanghai which we will refer to as APT1\xe2\x80\x99s home networks. In order to make a user\xe2\x80\x99s experience as seamless as possible, the Remote Desktop protocol requires client applications to forward several important details to the server, including their client hostname and the client keyboard layout. In 1,849 of the 1,905 (97%) APT1 Remote Desktop sessions we observed in the past two years , the keyboard layout setting was \xe2\x80\x9cChinese (Simplified) \xe2\x80\x94 US Keyboard.\xe2\x80\x9d One thing we did not originally provide was an analysis of the time of day and day of week that these 1,905 Remote Desktop (RDP) connections occurred. However, when we look at these connections in bar chart format, obvious patterns appear: Figure 1: APT1 Remote Desktop login times distributed by hour of day (China Standard Time)  Figure 2: APT1 Remote Desktop login times distributed by day of week (China Standard Time) Essentially, APT1 conducted almost all of the 1,905 RDP connections from 2011 to 2013: (1) On week days (Monday through Friday), (2) between 8am and noon, 2pm and 6pm, and 7pm and 10pm CST. On some occasions, APT1 personnel appear to have worked on weekends, but these are minor exceptions to the norm. Consider the following evidence together for the 1,905 RDP connections: 98.2% of IP addresses used to log in to hop points (which help mask the real point of origin to victim organizations) were from Shanghai networks 97% of the connections were from computers using the Simplified Chinese language setting 97.5% of the connections occurred on weekdays, China Standard Time 98.8% of the connections occurred between 7am and midnight China Standard Time 75% occurred between 8am to noon or between 2pm to 6pm 15% occurred between 7pm and 10pm The simplest conclusion based on these facts is that APT1 is operating in China, and most likely in Shanghai. Although one could attempt to explain every piece of evidence away, at some point the evidence starts to become overwhelming when it is all pointing in one direction. Our timestamp data, derived from active RDP logins over a two year period, matches the DOJ\xe2\x80\x99s timestamp data, derived from a different source -- active Dynamic DNS re-pointing over a five year period. These data sets show that APT1 is either operating in China during normal Chinese business hours or that APT1 is intentionally going to painstaking lengths to look like they are. The data used to produce the charts above are archived in raw format and we are confident that any computer networking expert would certify them as genuine and non-fabricated in a court of law. But, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t really the issue. The real issue is: will this activity continue and for how long? Regardless, FireEye remains focused on how these threats evolve over time, in order to reduce the time from \xe2\x80\x9cdetect\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cfix\xe2\x80\x9d, as these and other actors continue targeting potential victims.
